## ClassDef sample_property
**sample_property**: This class is used to decorate methods in a class, providing additional functionality related to database operations and property tracking.

**Attributes**:
- `method`: The method to be decorated. This is the only required parameter for the `sample_property` class.
- `name`: An optional parameter that allows for specifying a custom name for the decorated method. If not provided, the name of the method will be used.

**Code Description**: The `sample_property` class is a decorator for methods in a class. When a method is decorated with `sample_property`, it gains additional functionality related to database operations and property tracking. The `__init__` method sets the `method` and `name` attributes of the `sample_property` instance. The `__get__` method is called when the decorated method is accessed on an instance of the class. It checks if the instance is `None`, and if so, returns the `sample_property` instance itself. Otherwise, it calls the decorated method with the instance as an argument, and performs database operations and property tracking based on the result. The `__call__` method allows the `sample_property` instance to be called like a function, with the decorated method as the argument.

**Note**:
- When using `sample_property` to decorate a method, ensure that the method is idempotent, as it may be called multiple times during the course of a single request.
- The `name` parameter should be used when decorating a method that is intended to be used as a property, as it allows for specifying a custom name for the property.

**Output Example**:
```python
class TestClass:
    @sample_property
    def test_method(self):
        return "Hello, world!"

test_instance = TestClass()
print(test_instance.test_method)  # Output: "Hello, world!"
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, method, name)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the sample_property object with a given method and an optional name.

**parameters**:
· self: The instance of the sample_property class. It is a common practice in Python to include self as the first parameter of instance methods to refer to the instance.
· method: The method to be associated with the sample_property object. This parameter is required.
· name: The optional name to be given to the sample_property object. If not provided, the name of the method will be used as the name of the sample_property object.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ method is the constructor of the sample_property class. When a new instance of the class is created, the __init__ method is automatically called to initialize the object.

The method parameter is assigned to the self.method attribute of the sample_property object. This allows the method to be accessed and used by other methods in the class.

The __doc__ attribute of the method is also assigned to the self.__doc__ attribute of the sample_property object. This allows the documentation of the method to be accessed and used by other methods in the class.

The name parameter is optional. If provided, it is assigned to the self.name attribute of the sample_property object. If not provided, the name of the method is used as the name of the sample_property object.

**Note**:
When creating a new instance of the sample_property class, make sure to provide a valid method as the method parameter. The method will be associated with the sample_property object and can be accessed using the self.method attribute.

If you want to give a specific name to the sample_property object, make sure to provide a valid string as the name parameter. If not provided, the name of the method will be used as the name of the sample_property object.

It is important to note that the __doc__ attribute of the method is also assigned to the self.__doc__ attribute of the sample_property object. This allows the documentation of the method to be accessed and used by other methods in the class.
***
### FunctionDef __get__(self, inst, cls)
**__get__**: This function is responsible for retrieving the value of a property and managing database operations.

**Parameters**:
· self: This parameter represents the instance of the property class.
· inst: This parameter represents the instance of the class that contains the property.
· cls: This parameter represents the class that contains the property.

**Code Description**:
When the function is called, it first checks if the instance (inst) is None. If it is, the function returns the property instance (self).

If the instance is not None, the function calls the 'method' attribute of the property instance with the instance (inst) as a parameter. The result of this call is then checked to see if it is an instance of a list or a tuple. If it is, the function adds all the elements of the result to the database using the 'add_all' method of the 'db' attribute of the instance. If the result is not an instance of a list or a tuple, the function adds the result to the database using the 'add' method of the 'db' attribute of the instance.

The function then adds the name of the property to the 'used_properties' attribute of the instance and sets the attribute of the instance with the name of the property to the result of the call to the 'method' attribute of the property instance.

Finally, the function returns the result of the call to the 'method' attribute of the property instance.

**Note**:
This function is used to manage the retrieval of property values and database operations. It should be used in the context of a class that contains properties and a database connection.

**Output Example**:
Here is an example of the return value of the function:
```python
result = property_instance.__get__(instance, class)
print(result)
# Output: The result of calling the 'method' attribute of the property instance with the instance as a parameter.
```
***
### FunctionDef __call__(self, obj)
**__call__**: This function is a special method in Python classes, which is called when an instance of the class is called as a function.

**Parameters**:
- `self`: This parameter refers to the instance of the class. It is automatically passed to the method and represents the object that the method is being called on.
- `obj`: This parameter is an object that is passed to the method when it is called.

**Code Description**:
The `__call__` method is defined within the `sample_property` class in the `testalchemy.py` file. When an instance of this class is called as a function, this method is invoked. The method takes one parameter, `obj`, which is an object that is passed to the method when it is called. The method returns the result of calling the `method` attribute of the instance with `obj` as an argument.

**Note**:
- The `__call__` method allows instances of a class to be used as if they were functions.
- The `obj` parameter can be of any type, depending on the implementation of the `method` attribute of the instance.

**Output Example**:
Here is an example of how the `__call__` method might be used:
```python
instance = sample_property()
result = instance(some_object)
```
In this example, `instance` is an instance of the `sample_property` class. When `instance` is called as a function with `some_object` as an argument, the `__call__` method is invoked, and the result of calling the `method` attribute of `instance` with `some_object` as an argument is returned.
***
## ClassDef Sample
**Sample**: The function of the Sample class is to provide a base for creating objects with decorated methods and properties.

**Attributes**:
· `db`: The database session object used for interacting with the database.
· `used_properties`: A set to store the names of the properties that have been used.
· `__dict__`: A dictionary containing the instance variables of the object.

**Code Description**: The Sample class is a user-defined class that serves as a base for creating objects with decorated methods and properties. The class has a metaclass that decorates the methods and properties of the class during its creation. The metaclass checks for each attribute in the class and if it is a method, it decorates it with a sample_property object. The sample_property object is used to add functionality to the method, such as caching the result of the method call.

The Sample class also has an `__init__` method that is called when an instance of the class is created. The `__init__` method takes a database session object and keyword arguments as input. It sets the `db` attribute of the object to the database session object and the `used_properties` attribute to an empty set. It also updates the `__dict__` attribute of the object with the keyword arguments.

The Sample class has a `create_all` method that is used to create all the objects in the database. The method maps over all the attributes of the object and calls each attribute. If the attribute is a method, it will be called and its result will be cached. Finally, the method commits the changes to the database.

**Note**:

* The Sample class is designed to be used as a base class for other classes. It should not be instantiated directly.
* The Sample class uses a metaclass to decorate the methods and properties of the class. The metaclass checks for each attribute in the class and if it is a method, it decorates it with a sample_property object.
* The Sample class has an `__init__` method that takes a database session object and keyword arguments as input. It sets the `db` attribute of the object to the database session object and the `used_properties` attribute to an empty set. It also updates the `__dict__` attribute of the object with the keyword arguments.
* The Sample class has a `create_all` method that is used to create all the objects in the database. The method maps over all the attributes of the object and calls each attribute. If the attribute is a method, it will be called and its result will be cached. Finally, the method commits the changes to the database.

**Output Example**:

Here is an example of how the Sample class can be used to create a new object with decorated methods and properties:

```
class MySample(Sample):
    def method1(self):
        return "method1"

    def method2(self):
        return "method2"

my_sample = MySample(db)
my_sample.method1()  # returns "method1"
my_sample.method2()  # returns "method2"
```

In this example, the MySample class is a subclass of the Sample class. It has two methods, `method1` and `method2`. When an instance of the MySample class is created, the metaclass of the Sample class decorates the `method1` and `method2` methods with a sample_property object. This adds functionality to the methods, such as caching the result of the method call. When the `method1` and `method2` methods are called, they return the string "method1" and "method2", respectively.
### ClassDef __metaclass__
**__metaclass__**: This class is a metaclass used to modify the methods of a class by decorating them with a custom decorator.

**Attributes**:
· cls: The class object being created.
· cls_name: The name of the class being created.
· bases: The base classes of the class being created.
· attributes: The attributes of the class being created.

**Code Description**:
This metaclass is used to decorate the methods of a class with a custom decorator. When a new class is created, the `__new__` method of this metaclass is called. This method first calls the `__new__` method of the parent class (type) to create the new class object. Then, it iterates over the attributes of the new class object and checks if the attribute is a method. If it is, the method is decorated with a custom decorator. The custom decorator is created by calling the `sample_property` function with the method as a parameter. The name of the method is also passed as a parameter to the `sample_property` function.

**Note**:
This metaclass should be used with caution, as it modifies the behavior of the methods of a class. It is important to ensure that the custom decorator does not have any unintended side effects.

**Output Example**:
Here is an example of how this metaclass can be used to decorate the methods of a class:
```
class MyClass(metaclass=__metaclass__):
    def method1(self):
        pass

    def method2(self):
        pass

# The methods of MyClass will be decorated with the custom decorator
my_instance = MyClass()
```
#### FunctionDef __new__(cls, cls_name, bases, attributes)
**\_\_new\_\_**: The function of \_\_new\_\_ is to create a new instance of the class and decorate its methods with additional functionality related to database operations and property tracking.

**Parameters**:
· `cls`: The class for which a new instance is being created.
· `cls_name`: The name of the class.
· `bases`: The base classes of the class.
· `attributes`: The attributes of the class.

**Code Description**: The \_\_new\_\_ method is a special method in Python that is called when a new instance of a class is created. In this implementation, the method first calls the \_\_new\_\_ method of the type class to create a new instance of the class with the given `cls_name`, `bases`, and `attributes`. It then iterates over the attributes of the new instance and checks if they are methods. If a method is found, it is decorated with the `sample_property` class, which provides additional functionality related to database operations and property tracking. The `sample_property` class is a decorator that is used to decorate methods in a class. When a method is decorated with `sample_property`, it gains additional functionality related to database operations and property tracking. The `__get__` method is called when the decorated method is accessed on an instance of the class. It checks if the instance is `None`, and if so, returns the `sample_property` instance itself. Otherwise, it calls the decorated method with the instance as an argument, and performs database operations and property tracking based on the result. The `__call__` method allows the `sample_property` instance to be called like a function, with the decorated method as the argument.

**Note**:
* When using `sample_property` to decorate a method, ensure that the method is idempotent, as it may be called multiple times during the course of a single request.
* The `name` parameter should be used when decorating a method that is intended to be used as a property, as it allows for specifying a custom name for the property.

**Output Example**:
```python
class TestClass:
    @sample_property
    def test_method(self):
        return "Hello, world!"

test_instance = TestClass()
print(test_instance.test_method)  # Output: "Hello, world!"
```
***
***
### FunctionDef __init__(self, db)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the Sample class with a database object and optional keyword arguments.

**parameters**:
· self: The instance of the Sample class.
· db: The database object, which can be a ScopedSession or a registry.
· **kwargs: Optional keyword arguments to be stored as instance variables.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function is the constructor of the Sample class. It first checks if the db parameter is an instance of ScopedSession. If it is, the db object is replaced with its registry. This allows the Sample class to work with both ScopedSession and its registry.

The db object is then assigned to the self.db attribute of the Sample instance. This allows the instance to access the database throughout its lifetime.

The self.used_properties attribute is initialized as an empty set. This set is used to store the names of the properties that have been accessed during the lifetime of the instance.

Finally, the keyword arguments are added to the instance's dictionary using the update method. This allows the instance to have custom attributes that can be accessed using dot notation.

**Note**:
When using the Sample class, make sure to pass a valid database object to the constructor. The database object can be a ScopedSession or its registry. The keyword arguments can be used to set custom attributes of the instance. The used_properties set is used to keep track of the properties that have been accessed during the lifetime of the instance.
***
### FunctionDef create_all(self)
**create_all**: This function is responsible for creating all the necessary objects in the database.

**Parameters**:

* `self`: An instance of the `Sample` class.

**Code Description**:

The `create_all` function is a method within the `Sample` class. It is called to create all the necessary objects in the database. The function first checks if the database is in autocommit mode. If it is, the function begins a transaction using the `begin` method of the `db` object. Then, the function uses the `map` function to apply the `getattr` function to all the attributes of the `self` object. This is done to ensure that all the attributes of the `Sample` class are properly initialized. Finally, the function commits the transaction using the `commit` method of the `db` object.

The `create_all` function is called by several test cases in the `tests.py` module. These test cases create instances of various subclasses of `Sample` and call the `create_all` function to initialize the objects in the database. The test cases then use various assertions to verify that the objects have been created correctly.

**Note**:

* The `create_all` function assumes that the `db` object has `autocommit`, `begin`, and `commit` methods. The specific implementation of these methods will depend on the database library being used.
* The `create_all` function uses the `map` function to apply the `getattr` function to all the attributes of the `self` object. This is done to ensure that all the attributes of the `Sample` class are properly initialized. However, this approach may not be necessary if the `Sample` class is designed in such a way that all its attributes are properly initialized when the object is created.
* The `create_all` function is called by several test cases in the `tests.py` module. These test cases create instances of various subclasses of `Sample` and call the `create_all` function to initialize the objects in the database. The test cases then use various assertions to verify that the objects have been created correctly. Therefore, the `create_all` function plays a crucial role in the testing of the `Sample` class and its subclasses.
***
## ClassDef Restorable
**Restorable**: This class provides a context manager for a database session, allowing for automatic rollback and cleanup of changes made within the context.

**attributes**:
· `db`: The database session to be managed. This can be an instance of `ScopedSession` or a regular session.
· `watch`: An optional argument that defaults to the value of `db`. This is the session that will be monitored for changes.
· `history`: A dictionary that keeps track of the identity keys of new instances added to the session within the context.

**Code Description**:
The `Restorable` class is designed to manage a database session and ensure that any changes made within a specific context are automatically rolled back and cleaned up when the context is exited. This is achieved by implementing the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods, which are called when the context is entered and exited, respectively.

When the context is entered, the `__enter__` method listens for the `'after_flush'` event on the `watch` session. This event is triggered after the session has been flushed, allowing the `Restorable` class to keep track of any new instances added to the session.

When the context is exited, the `__exit__` method performs a series of cleanup operations. First, the session is rolled back and all instances are expunged from the session. Then, the autoflush setting is temporarily disabled to prevent any automatic flushing of the session. If the session is in autocommit mode, a new transaction is begun. Next, the `history` dictionary is used to delete all new instances that were added to the session within the context. Finally, the session is committed, the autoflush setting is restored, and the `'after_flush'` event listener is removed.

The `Restorable` class is used in several tests in the `tests.py` module. In each test, a `Restorable` context is created around a series of database operations. This allows the test to make changes to the database within the context, and then automatically roll back those changes when the context is exited. This is useful for testing the behavior of the database under various conditions, without actually modifying the database permanently.

**Note**:
* The `db` parameter can be either a `ScopedSession` or a regular session. If a `ScopedSession` is passed, it will be converted to a regular session using the `registry()` method.
* The `watch` parameter is optional and defaults to the value of `db`. This parameter determines which session will be monitored for changes.
* The `history` attribute is a dictionary that keeps track of the identity keys of new instances added to the session within the context. This is used to delete those instances when the context is exited.
* The `Restorable` class should be used in a `with` statement to create a context for the database session. Any database operations performed within this context will be automatically rolled back and cleaned up when the context is exited.
* The `Restorable` class is used in several tests in the `tests.py` module to test the behavior of the database under various conditions.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, db, watch)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the Restorable object.

**parameters**:
· self: The instance of the Restorable class.
· db: The database object to be used by the Restorable class. It can be an instance of ScopedSession or a registry object.
· watch: An optional parameter to specify an object to watch for changes. If not provided, the db object will be used as the watch object.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function is the constructor of the Restorable class. It takes two parameters, db and watch, with watch being an optional parameter.

First, the function checks if the db parameter is an instance of ScopedSession. If it is, the db object is replaced with the registry object of the ScopedSession. This is done to ensure that the correct registry object is used for the Restorable object.

Next, the db and watch parameters are assigned to the self.db and self.watch attributes of the Restorable object, respectively. If the watch parameter is not provided, the db object is used as the watch object.

Finally, an empty dictionary is assigned to the self.history attribute of the Restorable object. This dictionary will be used to store the history of changes made to the watched object.

**Note**:
When using the Restorable class, make sure to pass in a valid database object for the db parameter. If the watch parameter is not provided, the db object will be used as the watch object. The self.history attribute is used to store the history of changes made to the watched object, so it should be accessed and modified accordingly when implementing the functionality of the Restorable class.
***
### FunctionDef __enter__(self)
**\_\_enter\_\_**: This function is used to register the 'after_flush' event listener.

**Parameters**:
· self: The instance of the Restorable class.

**Code Description**:
The \_\_enter\_\_ function is a special method in Python, which is called when the object is used in a "with" statement. In this case, it is used to register the 'after_flush' event listener for the Restorable class instance. The 'after_flush' event is triggered after a flush operation on the database. By registering the 'after_flush' event listener, the after_flush function will be automatically called after each flush operation. This allows the Restorable class to keep track of the instances that have been flushed and to delete them if necessary in the \_\_exit\_\_ method.

**Note**:
It is important to ensure that the database session (db) is properly configured and that the instances in the db.new list are the ones that need to be tracked. Additionally, the history dictionary should be used with caution, as it can grow large and consume significant memory if not managed properly.
***
### FunctionDef __exit__(self, type, value, traceback)
**\_\_exit\_\_**: This function is responsible for cleaning up and committing changes to the database upon exiting the context manager.

**Parameters**:
· self: The instance of the Restorable class.
· type: The type of the exception that was raised, if any.
· value: The value of the exception that was raised, if any.
· traceback: The traceback of the exception that was raised, if any.

**Code Description**:
Upon exiting the context manager, the \_\_exit\_\_ function is called with the type, value, and traceback of any exception that was raised. The function first retrieves the database session object (db) from the Restorable instance (self).

Next, the function rolls back any uncommitted changes to the database and expunges all instances from the session. This ensures that any changes made within the context manager are discarded and not persisted to the database.

The function then temporarily disables autoflush on the database session to prevent automatic flushing of changes to the database. If the database session is in autocommit mode, the function begins a new transaction.

The function then iterates through the history dictionary, which keeps track of the instances that have been flushed during the context manager. For each class and set of identifiers in the history dictionary, the function retrieves the corresponding instance from the database session and deletes it. This ensures that any instances that were flushed during the context manager are permanently deleted from the database.

Finally, the function commits the changes to the database, closes the database session, and re-enables autoflush on the database session. The function also removes the after_flush function as a listener for the 'after_flush' event.

**Note**:
The \_\_exit\_\_ function is used to clean up and commit changes to the database upon exiting the context manager. It is important to ensure that the database session (db) is properly configured and that any instances that were flushed during the context manager are the ones that should be deleted. Additionally, the history dictionary should be used with caution, as it can grow large and consume significant memory if not managed properly.
***
### FunctionDef after_flush(self, db, flush_context, instances)
**after_flush**: This function is called after a flush operation is performed on the database.

**Parameters**:
· self: The instance of the Restorable class.
· db: The database session object.
· flush_context: The context of the flush operation.
· instances: Optional parameter, representing the instances that were flushed.

**Code Description**:
The after_flush function is triggered after a flush operation on the database. It iterates through the new instances in the database session (db.new) and retrieves the identity key (a tuple containing the class and identifier) for each instance. The identity key is then added to a history dictionary, which is specific to the class of the instance. This history dictionary keeps track of the identifiers of the instances that have been flushed.

The after_flush function is utilized in the \_\_enter\_\_ and \_\_exit\_\_ methods of the Restorable class. In the \_\_enter\_\_ method, the after_flush function is registered as a listener for the 'after_flush' event. This means that the after_flush function will be automatically called after each flush operation. In the \_\_exit\_\_ method, the after_flush function is used to delete the instances that were previously flushed. This is done by iterating through the history dictionary and deleting each instance that was previously flushed.

**Note**:
The after_flush function is used to keep track of the instances that have been flushed and to delete them if necessary. It is important to ensure that the database session (db) is properly configured and that the instances in the db.new list are the ones that need to be tracked. Additionally, the history dictionary should be used with caution, as it can grow large and consume significant memory if not managed properly.
***
## ClassDef DBHistory
An unknown error occurred while generating this documentation after many tries.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, session)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the DBHistory object.

**Parameters**:
· `session`: This parameter is an instance of either the `Session` or `ScopedSession` class. It represents the database session that the `DBHistory` object will use to interact with the database.

**Code Description**:
The `__init__` function is the constructor for the `DBHistory` class. When a new `DBHistory` object is created, this function is called automatically to initialize the object's attributes.

The function first checks that the `session` parameter is an instance of either the `Session` or `ScopedSession` class using the `isinstance` function. If the `session` parameter is not an instance of either of these classes, the function raises an `AssertionError`.

Next, the function sets the `session` attribute of the `DBHistory` object to the `session` parameter. This attribute represents the database session that the `DBHistory` object will use to interact with the database.

The function then checks if the `session` parameter is an instance of the `ScopedSession` class. If it is, the function sets the `_target` attribute of the `DBHistory` object to the result of calling the `registry` method on the `session` object. This is because when using a `ScopedSession`, the `registry` method returns the actual session object that is being used to interact with the database.

Finally, the function initializes several sets and dictionaries that will be used to keep track of the objects that have been created, updated, and deleted during the lifetime of the `DBHistory` object. These sets and dictionaries are `_created`, `_updated`, `_deleted`, `created_idents`, `updated_idents`, and `deleted_idents`.

**Note**:
When using the `DBHistory` class, it is important to pass in a valid `Session` or `ScopedSession` object as the `session` parameter. Failing to do so will result in an `AssertionError`. Additionally, it is important to note that the `_target` attribute of the `DBHistory` object will be set to the `registry` of the `ScopedSession` object if one is passed in as the `session` parameter. This is because the `registry` method returns the actual session object that is being used to interact with the database when using a `ScopedSession`.
***
### FunctionDef last(self, model_cls, mode)
**last**: This function retrieves the set of identities corresponding to the last operation (created, updated, or deleted) performed on a given model class.

**Parameters**:
· `self`: The instance of the DBHistory class.
· `model_cls`: The model class for which the identities of the last operation are to be retrieved.
· `mode`: The type of operation (created, updated, or deleted) to be considered. This parameter accepts only these three string values.

**Code Description**: The `last` function is a method of the `DBHistory` class that accepts a model class and an operation mode as parameters. It first asserts that the provided mode is valid, i.e., either 'created', 'updated', or 'deleted'. Then, it returns the set of identities associated with the provided mode for the given model class. These identities are stored in the `DBHistory` instance as attributes named after the operation mode, e.g., `created_idents`, `updated_idents`, or `deleted_idents`.

The function is called by other methods in the `DBHistory` class, such as `last_created`, `last_updated`, and `last_deleted`, which in turn are used to retrieve the actual objects corresponding to the retrieved identities. The `assert_` method also calls `last` to check if any instances of a given model class have undergone a specific operation.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the `mode` parameter is one of 'created', 'updated', or 'deleted'.
- The function returns a set of identities, which may be empty if no instances of the given model class have undergone the specified operation.

**Output Example**:
Suppose the `DBHistory` instance contains the following identities:

```python
self.created_idents = {
    'User': {1, 2, 3},
    'Post': {10, 11, 12}
}
self.updated_idents = {
    'User': {2, 3},
    'Post': {11, 12}
}
self.deleted_idents = {
    'User': {3},
    'Post': {12}
}
```

Calling `last(User, 'created')` would return `{1, 2, 3}`, while calling `last(Post, 'updated')` would return `{11, 12}`, and calling `last(User, 'deleted')` would return `{3}`.
***
### FunctionDef _idents_to_objects_set(self, idents, model_cls)
**_idents_to_objects_set**: This function converts a list of identifiers into a set of corresponding objects.

**Parameters**:
· `self`: The instance of the `DBHistory` class.
· `idents`: A list of identifiers for which the corresponding objects are to be fetched.
· `model_cls`: The class of the objects to be fetched.

**Code Description**: The `_idents_to_objects_set` function takes a list of identifiers and a model class as input, and returns a set of objects corresponding to those identifiers. The function uses the `session.query` method of the `self` instance to fetch the objects from the database. The `get` method is then used to retrieve the object corresponding to each identifier. The resulting objects are added to a set, which is returned at the end.

This function is called by several other functions in the `DBHistory` class, including `last_created`, `last_updated`, `assert_created`, and `assert_updated`. These functions use `_idents_to_objects_set` to fetch the objects corresponding to a list of identifiers, which are obtained by calling other methods of the `DBHistory` class.

**Note**:
* The order of the objects in the returned set is not guaranteed to be the same as the order of the identifiers in the input list.
* The function may return `None` for some identifiers if the corresponding objects do not exist in the database.

**Output Example**:
Suppose the `idents` parameter is `[1, 2, 3]` and the `model_cls` parameter is `MyModel`. The `_idents_to_objects_set` function may return a set that looks like this:
```python
{
    <MyModel object at 0x101234567>,
    <MyModel object at 0x102345678>,
    <MyModel object at 0x103456789>
}
```
where each `MyModel` object corresponds to one of the identifiers in the `idents` list.

### FunctionDef last_created(self, model_cls)
**last_created**: This function retrieves the set of objects corresponding to the last 'created' operation performed on a given model class.

**Parameters**:
· `self`: The instance of the DBHistory class.
· `model_cls`: The model class for which the objects of the last 'created' operation are to be retrieved.

**Code Description**: The `last_created` function is a method of the `DBHistory` class that accepts a model class as a parameter. It calls the `last` function with the 'created' mode to retrieve the set of identities associated with the 'created' mode for the given model class. Then, it passes the retrieved identities and the model class to the `_idents_to_objects_set` function to convert the list of identifiers into a set of corresponding objects. The resulting set of objects is returned by the `last_created` function.

The `last_created` function is called by other methods in the `DBHistory` class, such as `test_models_history_created`, `test_models_history_created_with_scoped_session`, and `test_models_history_updated`, to retrieve the actual objects corresponding to the last 'created' operation performed on a given model class.

**Note**:
- The `last_created` function calls the `last` function with the 'created' mode to retrieve the set of identities associated with the 'created' mode for the given model class.
- The `last_created` function then calls the `_idents_to_objects_set` function to convert the list of identifiers into a set of corresponding objects.

**Output Example**:
Suppose the `DBHistory` instance contains the following identities:

```python
self.created_idents = {
    'User': {1, 2, 3},
    'Post': {10, 11, 12}
}
```

Calling `last_created(User)` would return a set of `User` objects corresponding to the identifiers `{1, 2, 3}`. The actual objects returned would depend on the contents of the database. For example, if the `User` objects with identifiers `1`, `2`, and `3` have the names `'Alice'`, `'Bob'`, and `'Charlie'`, respectively, then the `last_created(User)` function might return a set that looks like this:

```python
{
    <User object at 0x101234567>,
    <User object at 0x102345678>,
    <User object at 0x103456789>
}
```

where each `User` object corresponds to one of the identifiers in the `created_idents` list for the `User` model class.
***
### FunctionDef last_updated(self, model_cls)
**last_updated**: This function retrieves the set of objects corresponding to the last update operation performed on a given model class.

**Parameters**:
· `self`: The instance of the DBHistory class.
· `model_cls`: The model class for which the objects of the last update operation are to be retrieved.

**Code Description**: The `last_updated` function is a method of the `DBHistory` class that accepts a model class as a parameter. It calls the `last` function with the 'updated' mode to retrieve the set of identities associated with the 'updated' mode for the given model class. Then, it converts the set of identities into a set of corresponding objects using the `_idents_to_objects_set` function.

This function is used in the `test_models_history_updated` test case to verify the functionality of the `last_updated` function. In this test case, a user object is created, updated, and then the `last_updated` function is called with the `User` model class to retrieve the updated user object.

**Note**:
- The `model_cls` parameter should be a valid model class.
- The function returns a set of objects, which may be empty if no instances of the given model class have undergone an update operation.

**Output Example**:
Suppose the `DBHistory` instance contains the following identities:

```python
self.updated_idents = {
    'User': {2, 3},
    'Post': {11, 12}
}
```

Calling `last_updated(User)` would return a set containing the updated user objects with IDs 2 and 3. The exact appearance of the return value would depend on the implementation of the `User` model class.
***
### FunctionDef last_deleted(self, model_cls)
**last_deleted**: This function retrieves the set of identities corresponding to the last deleted operation performed on a given model class.

**Parameters**:
· `self`: The instance of the DBHistory class.
· `model_cls`: The model class for which the identities of the last deleted operation are to be retrieved.

**Code Description**: The `last_deleted` function is a method of the `DBHistory` class that accepts a model class as a parameter. It calls the `last` function with the 'deleted' mode to retrieve the set of identities associated with the 'deleted' mode for the given model class. These identities are stored in the `DBHistory` instance as an attribute named `deleted_idents`.

The `last_deleted` function is called by other methods in the `DBHistory` class, such as `last_created` and `last_updated`, which in turn are used to retrieve the actual objects corresponding to the retrieved identities. The `assert_` method also calls `last_deleted` to check if any instances of a given model class have been deleted.

**Note**:
- The function returns a set of identities, which may be empty if no instances of the given model class have been deleted.
- The `last` function called by `last_deleted` checks if the provided mode is valid, i.e., either 'created', 'updated', or 'deleted'.

**Output Example**:
Suppose the `DBHistory` instance contains the following identities:

```python
self.created_idents = {
    'User': {1, 2, 3},
    'Post': {10, 11, 12}
}
self.updated_idents = {
    'User': {2, 3},
    'Post': {11, 12}
}
self.deleted_idents = {
    'User': {3},
    'Post': {12}
}
```

Calling `last_deleted(User)` would return `{3}`, while calling `last_deleted(Post)` would return `{12}`.
***
### FunctionDef assert_(self, model_cls, ident, mode)
**assert_**: This function verifies the existence of instances of a given model class that have undergone a specific operation.

**Parameters**:
· `self`: The instance of the DBHistory class.
· `model_cls`: The model class for which the instances are to be verified.
· `ident`: The identity of the instance to be verified. This parameter is optional and can be a single value or a tuple/list of values.
· `mode`: The type of operation (created, updated, or deleted) to be considered. This parameter accepts only these three string values.

**Code Description**: The `assert_` function is a method of the `DBHistory` class that accepts a model class, an operation mode, and an optional instance identity as parameters. It first calls the `last` function to retrieve the set of identities associated with the provided mode for the given model class. If the `ident` parameter is provided, it checks if the given identity is in the retrieved set of identities. If the identity is not found, it raises an assertion error with a descriptive message. The function returns the set of identities associated with the provided mode for the given model class.

The `assert_` function is called by other methods in the `DBHistory` class, such as `assert_created`, `assert_updated`, and `assert_deleted`, which in turn are used to verify the existence of instances of a given model class that have undergone a specific operation.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the `mode` parameter is one of 'created', 'updated', or 'deleted'.
- The function returns a set of identities, which may be empty if no instances of the given model class have undergone the specified operation.
- If the `ident` parameter is provided, the function checks if the given identity is in the retrieved set of identities and raises an assertion error if it is not found.

**Output Example**:
Suppose the `DBHistory` instance contains the following identities:

```python
self.created_idents = {
    'User': {1, 2, 3},
    'Post': {10, 11, 12}
}
self.updated_idents = {
    'User': {2, 3},
    'Post': {11, 12}
}
self.deleted_idents = {
    'User': {3},
    'Post': {12}
}
```

Calling `assert_(User, 'created')` would return `{1, 2, 3}`, while calling `assert_(Post, 'updated')` would return `{11, 12}`, and calling `assert_(User, 'deleted')` would return `{3}`. If `assert_(User, 'created', 4)` is called, it would raise an assertion error since the identity `4` is not in the set of created identities for the `User` model class.
***
### FunctionDef assert_created(self, model_cls, ident)
**assert_created**: This function verifies the existence of instances of a given model class that have been created.

**Parameters**:
- `self`: The instance of the DBHistory class.
- `model_cls`: The model class for which the instances are to be verified.
- `ident`: The identity of the instance to be verified. This parameter is optional and can be a single value or a tuple/list of values.

**Code Description**: The `assert_created` function is a method of the `DBHistory` class that accepts a model class and an optional instance identity as parameters. It first calls the `assert_` function to retrieve the set of identities associated with the 'created' mode for the given model class. If the `ident` parameter is provided, it checks if the given identity is in the retrieved set of identities. If the identity is not found, it raises an assertion error with a descriptive message. The function returns the set of identities associated with the 'created' mode for the given model class.

The `assert_created` function is called by other methods in the `DBHistory` class, such as `assert_created_one`, which in turn are used to verify the existence of instances of a given model class that have been created.

**Note**:
- The `assert_` function called by `assert_created` checks if the `mode` parameter is one of 'created', 'updated', or 'deleted'.
- The function returns a set of identities, which may be empty if no instances of the given model class have been created.
- If the `ident` parameter is provided, the function checks if the given identity is in the retrieved set of identities and raises an assertion error if it is not found.

**Output Example**:
Suppose the `DBHistory` instance contains the following identities:

```python
self.created_idents = {
    'User': {1, 2, 3},
    'Post': {10, 11, 12}
}
self.updated_idents = {
    'User': {2, 3},
    'Post': {11, 12}
}
self.deleted_idents = {
    'User': {3},
    'Post': {12}
}
```

Calling `assert_created(User)` would return `{1, 2, 3}`, while calling `assert_created(Post)` would return `{10, 11, 12}`. If `assert_created(User, 4)` is called, it would raise an assertion error since the identity `4` is not in the set of created identities for the `User` model class.
***
### FunctionDef assert_updated(self, model_cls, ident)
**assert_updated**: This function verifies the existence of instances of a given model class that have undergone an update operation.

**Parameters**:
· `self`: The instance of the DBHistory class.
· `model_cls`: The model class for which the instances are to be verified.
· `ident`: The identity of the instance to be verified. This parameter is optional and can be a single value or a tuple/list of values.

**Code Description**: The `assert_updated` function is a method of the `DBHistory` class that accepts a model class and an optional instance identity as parameters. It first calls the `assert_` function to retrieve the set of identities associated with the 'updated' mode for the given model class. If the `ident` parameter is provided, it checks if the given identity is in the retrieved set of identities. If the identity is not found, it raises an assertion error with a descriptive message. The function returns the set of identities associated with the 'updated' mode for the given model class.

The `assert_updated` function is called by other methods in the `DBHistory` class, such as `assert_updated_one`, which in turn are used to verify the existence of instances of a given model class that have undergone an update operation.

**Note**:
- The `ident` parameter is optional and can be a single value or a tuple/list of values.
- The function returns a set of identities, which may be empty if no instances of the given model class have undergone an update operation.
- If the `ident` parameter is provided, the function checks if the given identity is in the retrieved set of identities and raises an assertion error if it is not found.

**Output Example**:
Suppose the `DBHistory` instance contains the following identities:

```python
self.updated_idents = {
    'User': {2, 3},
    'Post': {11, 12}
}
```

Calling `assert_updated(User)` would return `{2, 3}`, while calling `assert_updated(Post)` would return `{11, 12}`. If `assert_updated(User, 4)` is called, it would raise an assertion error since the identity `4` is not in the set of updated identities for the `User` model class.

The `assert_updated` function is called by the `assert_updated_one` function, which verifies the existence of a single instance of a given model class that has undergone an update operation. The `assert_updated_one` function calls `assert_updated` to retrieve the set of updated identities for the given model class, and then checks if the set contains the given identity. If the set contains the identity, the function returns the corresponding object. If the set does not contain the identity, the function raises an assertion error.

For example, if `assert_updated_one(User, 2)` is called, it would return the `User` object with an identity of `2` if it exists and has undergone an update operation. If the `User` object with an identity of `2` does not exist or has not undergone an update operation, the function would raise an assertion error.

The `assert_updated` function is also called by several test functions in the `tests.py` file, such as `test_models_history_created`, `test_models_history_updated`, and `test_models_history_deleted`. These test functions use `assert_updated` to verify the existence of instances of a given model class that have undergone an update operation in different scenarios. For example, the `test_models_history_updated` function creates a `User` object, updates its name, and then calls `assert_updated` to verify that the `User` object has undergone an update operation.
***
### FunctionDef assert_deleted(self, model_cls, ident)
**assert_deleted**: This function verifies the deletion of instances of a given model class.

**Parameters**:
- `self`: The instance of the DBHistory class.
- `model_cls`: The model class for which the instances are to be verified.
- `ident`: The identity of the instance to be verified. This parameter is optional and can be a single value or a tuple/list of values.

**Code Description**: The `assert_deleted` function is a method of the `DBHistory` class that accepts a model class and an optional instance identity as parameters. It calls the `assert_` function with the 'deleted' mode to verify the deletion of instances of the given model class. If the `ident` parameter is provided, it checks if the given identity is in the retrieved set of identities associated with the 'deleted' mode for the given model class. If the identity is not found, it raises an assertion error with a descriptive message. The function returns the set of identities associated with the 'deleted' mode for the given model class.

**Note**:
- The function returns a set of identities, which may be empty if no instances of the given model class have been deleted.
- If the `ident` parameter is provided, the function checks if the given identity is in the retrieved set of identities and raises an assertion error if it is not found.

**Output Example**:
Suppose the `DBHistory` instance contains the following identities:

```python
self.created_idents = {
    'User': {1, 2, 3},
    'Post': {10, 11, 12}
}
self.updated_idents = {
    'User': {2, 3},
    'Post': {11, 12}
}
self.deleted_idents = {
    'User': {3},
    'Post': {12}
}
```

Calling `assert_deleted(User)` would return `{3}`, while calling `assert_deleted(Post)` would return `{12}`, and calling `assert_deleted(User, 3)` would return `{3}`. If `assert_deleted(User, 4)` is called, it would raise an assertion error since the identity `4` is not in the set of deleted identities for the `User` model class.
***
### FunctionDef assert_one(self, dataset, model_cls, mode)
**assert_one**: This function checks if the dataset contains exactly one instance of a given model class in a specific mode, and returns the instance if the condition is met.

**Parameters**:
· `self`: The instance of the DBHistory class.
· `dataset`: The dataset to be checked.
· `model_cls`: The model class to be checked in the dataset.
· `mode`: The mode of the model class.

**Code Description**: The `assert_one` function first checks if the length of the `dataset` is equal to 1. If not, it raises an `AssertionError` with a message indicating the number of instances found and the expected number. If the length of the `dataset` is 1, it returns the instance by using the `pop()` method.

This function is called by other functions in the `DBHistory` class, such as `assert_created_one`, `assert_deleted_one`, and `assert_updated_one`. These functions first call the corresponding `assert_created`, `assert_deleted`, or `assert_updated` function to get the dataset, and then call the `assert_one` function to check the dataset and return the instance.

**Note**:
· The `dataset` parameter should contain instances of the `model_cls` parameter.
· The `mode` parameter should be a string indicating the mode of the `model_cls` parameter.
· The function raises an `AssertionError` if the `dataset` does not contain exactly one instance of the `model_cls` in the specified `mode`.

**Output Example**:
```python
dataset = [instance1]
model_cls = ModelClass
mode = 'created'

result = assert_one(dataset, model_cls, mode)
print(result)  # Output: instance1
```
***
### FunctionDef assert_created_one(self, model_cls)
**assert_created_one**: This function verifies the existence of a single instance of a given model class that has been created.

**Parameters**:
· `self`: The instance of the DBHistory class.
· `model_cls`: The model class for which the instance is to be verified.

**Code Description**: The `assert_created_one` function is a method of the `DBHistory` class that accepts a model class as a parameter. It first calls the `assert_created` function to retrieve the set of identities associated with the 'created' mode for the given model class. If the set contains exactly one identity, the function returns the corresponding instance of the model class. If the set is empty or contains more than one identity, it raises an `AssertionError` with a descriptive message.

This function is called by other methods in the `DBHistory` class, such as `test_models_history_created` and `test_models_history_created_with_scoped_session`, to verify the existence of a single instance of a given model class that has been created.

**Note**:
- The `assert_created` function called by `assert_created_one` checks if the `mode` parameter is one of 'created', 'updated', or 'deleted'.
- The function raises an `AssertionError` if the set of identities associated with the 'created' mode for the given model class does not contain exactly one identity.
- The function returns the instance of the given model class that has been created.

**Output Example**:
Suppose the `DBHistory` instance contains the following identities:

```python
self.created_idents = {
    'User': {1, 2, 3},
    'Post': {10, 11, 12}
}
self.updated_idents = {
    'User': {2, 3},
    'Post': {11, 12}
}
self.deleted_idents = {
    'User': {3},
    'Post': {12}
}
```

Calling `assert_created_one(User)` would return an instance of the `User` model class with an identity of 1, 2, or 3. If `assert_created_one(User, 4)` is called, it would raise an `AssertionError` since the identity `4` is not in the set of created identities for the `User` model class.
***
### FunctionDef assert_deleted_one(self, model_cls)
**assert_deleted_one**: This function verifies the deletion of a specific instance of a given model class and returns the instance if it is found in the deleted identities.

**Parameters**:
- `self`: The instance of the DBHistory class.
- `model_cls`: The model class for which the instances are to be verified.

**Code Description**: The `assert_deleted_one` function is a method of the `DBHistory` class that accepts a model class as a parameter. It calls the `assert_deleted` function with the given model class to verify the deletion of instances of the model class. The `assert_deleted` function returns a set of identities associated with the 'deleted' mode for the given model class. The `assert_deleted_one` function then calls the `assert_one` function with the result of `assert_deleted`, the given model class, and the 'deleted' mode. The `assert_one` function checks if the dataset contains exactly one instance of the given model class in the specified mode and returns the instance if the condition is met. If the instance is not found, it raises an `AssertionError` with a descriptive message.

This function is called in the `test_models_history_deleted` function in the `tests.py/Test` module to verify the deletion of a specific instance of a given model class. It is also called in the `test_models_history_created` and `test_models_history_updated` functions to test the assertion error when the instance is not found in the deleted identities.

**Note**:
- The function returns the instance of the given model class if it is found in the deleted identities.
- If the instance is not found, the function raises an `AssertionError` with a descriptive message.

**Output Example**:
Suppose the `DBHistory` instance contains the following identities:

```python
self.created_idents = {
    'User': {1, 2, 3},
    'Post': {10, 11, 12}
}
self.updated_idents = {
    'User': {2, 3},
    'Post': {11, 12}
}
self.deleted_idents = {
    'User': {3},
    'Post': {12}
}
```

Calling `assert_deleted_one(User)` would return the instance of the `User` model class with the identity `3` if it exists in the deleted identities. If the instance is not found, it would raise an `AssertionError` with a descriptive message.
***
### FunctionDef assert_updated_one(self, model_cls)
**assert_updated_one**: This function verifies the existence of a single instance of a given model class that has undergone an update operation.

**Parameters**:
· `self`: The instance of the DBHistory class.
· `model_cls`: The model class for which the instance is to be verified.

**Code Description**: The `assert_updated_one` function is a method of the `DBHistory` class that accepts a model class as a parameter. It first calls the `assert_updated` function to retrieve the set of identities associated with the 'updated' mode for the given model class. If the set contains the identity of the instance, the function returns the corresponding object. If the set does not contain the identity, the function raises an assertion error.

The `assert_updated` function is called by the `assert_updated_one` function to retrieve the set of updated identities for the given model class. The `assert_updated` function is a method of the `DBHistory` class that accepts a model class and an optional instance identity as parameters. It first calls the `assert_` function to retrieve the set of identities associated with the 'updated' mode for the given model class. If the `ident` parameter is provided, it checks if the given identity is in the retrieved set of identities. If the identity is not found, it raises an assertion error with a descriptive message. The function returns the set of identities associated with the 'updated' mode for the given model class.

The `assert_one` function is called by the `assert_updated_one` function to check if the set contains exactly one instance of the given model class in the 'updated' mode. The `assert_one` function is a method of the `DBHistory` class that accepts a dataset, a model class, and a mode as parameters. It first checks if the length of the `dataset` is equal to 1. If not, it raises an `AssertionError` with a message indicating the number of instances found and the expected number. If the length of the `dataset` is 1, it returns the instance by using the `pop()` method.

The `assert_updated_one` function is called by several test functions in the `tests.py` file, such as `test_models_history_updated`. These test functions use `assert_updated_one` to verify the existence of a single instance of a given model class that has undergone an update operation in different scenarios.

**Note**:
· The `model_cls` parameter should be a valid model class.
· The function raises an `AssertionError` if the set of updated identities does not contain exactly one instance of the `model_cls`.

**Output Example**:
Suppose the `DBHistory` instance contains the following identities:

```python
self.updated_idents = {
    'User': {2, 3},
    'Post': {11, 12}
}
```

Calling `assert_updated_one(User)` would return the `User` object with an identity of `2` or `3` if it exists and has undergone an update operation. If the `User` object with an identity of `2` or `3` does not exist or has not undergone an update operation, the function would raise an assertion error.
***
### FunctionDef assert_nothing_happened(self)
**assert_nothing_happened**: This function checks if any changes have been made to the database.

**Parameters**:
· self: This is the instance of the DBHistory class.

**Code Description**:
The `assert_nothing_happened` function is a method within the DBHistory class. It is used to confirm that no changes have been made to the database. This function checks three attributes of the DBHistory class: `created_idents`, `updated_idents`, and `deleted_idents`. These attributes keep track of any changes made to the database during the session. If any of these attributes contain elements, it means that changes have been made, and the function will raise an AssertionError with an appropriate message.

This function is called in several test cases in the project. In the `test_nothing_happened_does_not_throw_when_nothing_happened` test case, the function is called after querying the User table without making any changes. In this case, the function does not raise an error, as expected.

In the `test_nothing_happened_throws_on_creating` test case, the function is called after adding a new User to the database. This results in the `created_idents` attribute being populated, causing the function to raise an AssertionError.

Similarly, in the `test_nothing_happened_throws_on_update` test case, the function is called after updating an existing User in the database. This results in the `updated_idents` attribute being populated, causing the function to raise an AssertionError.

Finally, in the `test_nothing_happened_throws_on_delete` test case, the function is called after deleting a User from the database. This results in the `deleted_idents` attribute being populated, causing the function to raise an AssertionError.

**Note**:
When using the `assert_nothing_happened` function, ensure that it is called after any database operations have been completed. This function should be used to confirm that no changes have been made to the database during a session. If any changes have been made, the function will raise an AssertionError.
***
### FunctionDef clear(self)
**clear**: The function of clear is to reset the identifiers of created, updated, and deleted objects and clear the cache.

**Parameters**:
This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The `clear` function is a method within the `DBHistory` class in the `testalchemy.py` project. Its purpose is to reset the identifiers of created, updated, and deleted objects and clear the cache. This is achieved by setting the `created_idents`, `updated_idents`, and `deleted_idents` attributes to empty dictionaries and calling the `clear_cache` function.

The `clear_cache` function is responsible for resetting the cache of created, updated, and deleted objects. It does this by setting the `_created`, `_updated`, and `_deleted` attributes to empty sets. This ensures that the cache is cleared before the `DBHistory` object is used again.

The `clear` function is called in several other methods within the `DBHistory` class, including `__enter__`, `__exit__`, `_after_commit`, and `_after_rollback`. In each of these methods, `clear` is called to reset the identifiers and clear the cache before or after performing other operations.

For example, in the `__enter__` method, `clear` is called at the beginning of the method to reset the identifiers and clear the cache before the `DBHistory` object is used in a context manager. This ensures that the cache is cleared before any new operations are performed.

In the `__exit__` method, `clear` is called at the end of the method to reset the identifiers and clear the cache after the `DBHistory` object is no longer needed. This ensures that the cache is cleared before the object is destroyed.

In the `_after_commit` method, `clear` is called after populating the `created_idents`, `updated_idents`, and `deleted_idents` attributes with the contents of the `_created`, `_updated`, and `_deleted` attributes. This ensures that the cache is cleared after the changes have been committed to the database.

Finally, in the `_after_rollback` method, `clear` is called after rolling back the database transaction. This ensures that the cache is cleared after any changes made during the transaction have been undone.

**Note**:
It is important to note that `clear` does not take any parameters and does not return any values. Its sole purpose is to reset the identifiers of created, updated, and deleted objects and clear the cache. It is called in several other methods within the `DBHistory` class to ensure that the cache is cleared before or after performing other operations.
***
### FunctionDef clear_cache(self)
**clear_cache**: This function is responsible for resetting the cache of created, updated, and deleted objects.

**Parameters**:
This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The `clear_cache` function is a method within the `DBHistory` class in the `testalchemy.py` project. Its purpose is to reset the cache of created, updated, and deleted objects by setting the `_created`, `_updated`, and `_deleted` attributes to empty sets.

This function is called in several other methods within the `DBHistory` class, including `clear`, `__enter__`, `__exit__`, `_after_commit`, and `_after_rollback`. In each of these methods, `clear_cache` is called to reset the cache before or after performing other operations.

For example, in the `clear` method, `clear_cache` is called after resetting the `created_idents`, `updated_idents`, and `deleted_idents` attributes. This ensures that the cache is cleared before the `DBHistory` object is used again.

Similarly, in the `__enter__` method, `clear_cache` is called at the beginning of the method to reset the cache before the `DBHistory` object is used in a context manager. This ensures that the cache is cleared before any new operations are performed.

In the `__exit__` method, `clear_cache` is called at the end of the method to reset the cache after the `DBHistory` object is no longer needed. This ensures that the cache is cleared before the object is destroyed.

In the `_after_commit` method, `clear_cache` is called after populating the `created_idents`, `updated_idents`, and `deleted_idents` attributes with the contents of the `_created`, `_updated`, and `_deleted` attributes. This ensures that the cache is cleared after the changes have been committed to the database.

Finally, in the `_after_rollback` method, `clear_cache` is called after rolling back the database transaction. This ensures that the cache is cleared after any changes made during the transaction have been undone.

**Note**:
It is important to note that `clear_cache` does not take any parameters and does not return any values. Its sole purpose is to reset the cache of created, updated, and deleted objects. It is called in several other methods within the `DBHistory` class to ensure that the cache is cleared before or after performing other operations.

### FunctionDef __enter__(self)
**__enter__**: This function is responsible for initializing the DBHistory object when used in a context manager.

**Parameters**:
· `self`: This is the instance of the `DBHistory` class that the function belongs to. It is used to access the class variables and methods.

**Code Description**:
The `__enter__` function is a special method in Python that is called when an object is used in a `with` statement. In the context of the `DBHistory` class, this function is used to initialize the object and set up any necessary event listeners.

When the `__enter__` function is called, it first sets up three event listeners using the `event.listen` function. These event listeners are registered with the `_target` object, which is the database session that the `DBHistory` object is tracking. The event listeners are set up to call the `_after_flush`, `_after_commit`, and `_after_rollback` functions when the corresponding events are triggered in the database session.

After setting up the event listeners, the `__enter__` function calls the `clear_cache` function to reset the cache of created, updated, and deleted objects. This ensures that the cache is cleared before the `DBHistory` object is used in a context manager.

Finally, the `__enter__` function returns the `self` object, which allows the `DBHistory` object to be used in a `with` statement.

**Note**:
* The `__enter__` function should be used in conjunction with the `__exit__` function to ensure that the `DBHistory` object is properly initialized and cleaned up when used in a context manager.
* The `__enter__` function sets up event listeners for the `after_flush`, `after_commit`, and `after_rollback` events in the database session. These event listeners are used to track changes made to the database during a transaction.
* The `clear_cache` function is called in the `__enter__` function to reset the cache of created, updated, and deleted objects. This ensures that the cache is cleared before the `DBHistory` object is used in a context manager.

**Output Example**:
Here's an example of how the `__enter__` function might be used in a `with` statement:
```python
with DBHistory(some_database_session) as db_history:
    # Perform some operations on the database
    #...
```
In this example, the `DBHistory` object is initialized using the `some_database_session` object. The `__enter__` function is called automatically when the `with` statement is executed, and the `DBHistory` object is initialized and set up with event listeners. After the operations in the `with` block are completed, the `__exit__` function is called automatically to clean up the `DBHistory` object.
***
### FunctionDef __exit__(self, type, value, traceback)
**__exit__**: This function is responsible for removing event listeners and resetting the cache of created, updated, and deleted objects when the DBHistory object is no longer needed.

**Parameters**:
· `self`: The instance of the DBHistory class that the function belongs to.
· `type`: The type of the exception that was raised in the context manager, if any.
· `value`: The value of the exception that was raised in the context manager, if any.
· `traceback`: The traceback of the exception that was raised in the context manager, if any.

**Code Description**:
The `__exit__` function is a special method in Python that is called when a context manager is exited. In the case of the DBHistory class, this function is used to remove event listeners and reset the cache of created, updated, and deleted objects when the object is no longer needed.

The function takes four parameters: `self`, `type`, `value`, and `traceback`. `self` is the instance of the DBHistory class that the function belongs to, while `type`, `value`, and `traceback` are the type, value, and traceback of the exception that was raised in the context manager, if any. However, the function does not use these parameters in its implementation.

The function's implementation consists of three main steps:

1. Removing event listeners: The function removes event listeners for the `after_flush`, `after_commit`, and `after_soft_rollback` events of the database session object. This is done by calling the `remove_event` function three times, once for each event.
2. Resetting the cache: The function resets the cache of created, updated, and deleted objects by calling the `clear_cache` method of the DBHistory class. This method sets the `_created`, `_updated`, and `_deleted` attributes of the DBHistory object to empty sets.
3. Clearing the cache: The function calls the `clear_cache` method of the DBHistory class to reset the cache of created, updated, and deleted objects. This method is also called in several other methods within the DBHistory class, including `clear`, `__enter__`, `_after_flush`, `_after_commit`, and `_after_rollback`. In each of these methods, `clear_cache` is called to reset the cache before or after performing other operations.

**Note**:
The `__exit__` function is called automatically when a context manager is exited. It is used to clean up resources and reset the state of the object. In the case of the DBHistory class, this function is used to remove event listeners and reset the cache of created, updated, and deleted objects when the object is no longer needed. It is important to note that the function does not take any parameters and does not return any values. Its sole purpose is to clean up resources and reset the state of the object.

### FunctionDef _populate_idents_dict(self, idents, objects)
**_populate_idents_dict**: This function is responsible for populating the identity dictionary with the objects provided.

**Parameters**:
· `self`: This is the instance of the class that the function belongs to. It is used to access the class variables and methods.
· `idents`: This is a dictionary that will be populated with the identities of the objects. The keys of the dictionary are the types of the objects and the values are sets of the identities of the objects of that type.
· `objects`: This is a list of objects that will be used to populate the `idents` dictionary.

**Code Description**:
The `_populate_idents_dict` function takes in two parameters, `idents` and `objects`, and uses them to populate the `idents` dictionary with the identities of the objects in the `objects` list. The function uses a for loop to iterate over each object in the `objects` list. For each object, it uses the `util.identity_key` function to get the identity of the object, which is returned as a tuple. The function then uses the `setdefault` method of the `idents` dictionary to create a new set for the type of the object if it does not already exist, and then adds the identity of the object to the set.

This function is called by the `_after_commit` function in the `DBHistory` class. The `_after_commit` function calls `_populate_idents_dict` three times, once for each of the `created_idents`, `updated_idents`, and `deleted_idents` dictionaries, and passes in the corresponding list of objects. This is done to update the identity dictionaries with the identities of the objects that were created, updated, or deleted in the transaction.

**Note**:
* The `idents` dictionary is being populated with the identities of the objects, not the objects themselves.
* The `setdefault` method is used to create a new set for the type of the object if it does not already exist, and then adds the identity of the object to the set.
* The `_populate_idents_dict` function is called by the `_after_commit` function in the `DBHistory` class to update the identity dictionaries with the identities of the objects that were created, updated, or deleted in the transaction.
***
### FunctionDef _after_flush(self, db, flush_context, instances)
**_after_flush**: This function updates the _created, _updated, and _deleted attributes of the DBHistory object after a flush event in the database.

**Parameters**:
· self: The DBHistory object that the function belongs to.
· db: The database session object that triggered the flush event.
· flush_context: The context of the flush event.
· instances: An optional parameter that is not used in the function.

**Code Description**:
The _after_flush function is called after a flush event in the database. It takes four parameters: self, db, flush_context, and instances. The instances parameter is not used in the function.

The function defines an inner function called identityset_to_set, which takes an object as an argument and returns a set of its members' values.

The function then updates the _created, _updated, and _deleted attributes of the DBHistory object by taking the union of their current values with the set of new, dirty, and deleted objects in the database, respectively. The new, dirty, and deleted objects are obtained by calling the identityset_to_set function on the db.new, db.dirty, and db.deleted attributes of the database session object, respectively.

**Note**:
The _after_flush function is called by the __enter__ and __exit__ methods of the DBHistory object. It is used to track the changes made to the database during a transaction. The function should be used in conjunction with the __enter__ and __exit__ methods to ensure that the changes are properly tracked.

**Output Example**:
Here's an example of how the _after_flush function might be used in the __enter__ method of the DBHistory object:
```python
def __enter__(self):
    event.listen(self._target, 'after_flush', self._after_flush)
    event.listen(self._target, 'after_commit', self._after_commit)
    event.listen(self._target, 'after_soft_rollback',
                 self._after_rollback)
    self.clear_cache()
    return self
```
In this example, the _after_flush function is registered as a listener for the after_flush event of the database session object. When the after_flush event is triggered, the _after_flush function is called and updates the _created, _updated, and _deleted attributes of the DBHistory object.
#### FunctionDef identityset_to_set(obj)
**identityset_to_set**: The function of identityset_to_set is to convert the values of an object's _members attribute into a set.

**Parameters**:
· obj: The object whose _members values are to be converted into a set.

**Code Description**:
The function takes an object as an argument and returns a set containing the values of the object's _members attribute. The _members attribute is expected to be a dictionary, and the values method is used to extract the values from the dictionary. The set function is then used to convert the list of values into a set.

**Note**:
Ensure that the obj parameter passed to the function has a _members attribute that is a dictionary. If the _members attribute is not present or is not a dictionary, the function will raise an error.

**Output Example**:
If the _members attribute of the obj parameter is {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}, the output of the function will be {1, 2, 3}.

### FunctionDef _after_commit(self, db)
**_after_commit**: This function is responsible for performing post-commit operations in the database transaction.

**Parameters**:
· `self`: This is the instance of the `DBHistory` class that the function belongs to. It is used to access the class variables and methods.
· `db`: This is the database session object that is used to interact with the database.

**Code Description**:
The `_after_commit` function is a method within the `DBHistory` class in the `testalchemy.py` project. Its purpose is to perform post-commit operations in the database transaction. The function first checks if the database transaction is nested. If it is, the function returns without performing any further operations, as the `after_commit` function is not expected to be called within nested transactions.

If the database transaction is not nested, the function proceeds to call the `_populate_idents_dict` function three times, once for each of the `created_idents`, `updated_idents`, and `deleted_idents` dictionaries. The function passes in the corresponding list of objects that were created, updated, or deleted in the transaction. This is done to update the identity dictionaries with the identities of the objects that were created, updated, or deleted in the transaction.

After populating the identity dictionaries, the function calls the `clear_cache` function to reset the cache of created, updated, and deleted objects. This ensures that the cache is cleared after the changes have been committed to the database.

**Note**:
* The `_after_commit` function is called by the `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods in the `DBHistory` class, as well as by the `after_commit` event listener.
* The function checks if the database transaction is nested before performing any operations. If the transaction is nested, the function returns without performing any further operations.
* The function calls the `_populate_idents_dict` function three times, once for each of the `created_idents`, `updated_idents`, and `deleted_idents` dictionaries, to update the identity dictionaries with the identities of the objects that were created, updated, or deleted in the transaction.
* The function calls the `clear_cache` function to reset the cache of created, updated, and deleted objects after populating the identity dictionaries.

**Output Example**:
The `_after_commit` function does not return any value. Instead, it performs post-commit operations in the database transaction and updates the identity dictionaries with the identities of the objects that were created, updated, or deleted in the transaction. The function also resets the cache of created, updated, and deleted objects after populating the identity dictionaries.
***
### FunctionDef _after_rollback(self, db, prev_tx)
**_after_rollback**: This function is responsible for resetting the cache of created, updated, and deleted objects after a database rollback.

**Parameters**:
- `self`: The instance of the `DBHistory` class.
- `db`: The database connection object.
- `prev_tx`: The previous transaction object.

**Code Description**:
The `_after_rollback` function is a method within the `DBHistory` class in the `testalchemy.py` project. Its purpose is to reset the cache of created, updated, and deleted objects after a database rollback. This function is called in the `__exit__` method of the `DBHistory` class, which is invoked when the object is no longer needed. The `__exit__` method removes event listeners and then calls the `_after_rollback` function to reset the cache.

The `_after_rollback` function takes three parameters: `self`, `db`, and `prev_tx`. `self` is the instance of the `DBHistory` class, `db` is the database connection object, and `prev_tx` is the previous transaction object. However, the function does not use these parameters in its implementation.

The function's implementation is simple: it calls the `clear_cache` method of the `DBHistory` class. The `clear_cache` method resets the cache of created, updated, and deleted objects by setting the `_created`, `_updated`, and `_deleted` attributes to empty sets.

The `clear_cache` method is also called in several other methods within the `DBHistory` class, including `clear`, `__enter__`, `__exit__`, `_after_commit`, and `_after_rollback`. In each of these methods, `clear_cache` is called to reset the cache before or after performing other operations.

**Note**:
The `_after_rollback` function does not take any parameters and does not return any values. Its sole purpose is to reset the cache of created, updated, and deleted objects after a database rollback. It is called in the `__exit__` method of the `DBHistory` class to ensure that the cache is cleared after any changes made during the transaction have been undone.
