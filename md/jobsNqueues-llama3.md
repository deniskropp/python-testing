## ClassDef Queue
 **Queue**
The function of Queue is to implement a basic First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure that allows adding and removing items in a specific order.

**attributes**
· `_data`: A list that stores the items in the queue.

**Code Description**
This class defines a simple implementation of a Queue data structure, which can be used to manage tasks or jobs in a particular order. The constructor initializes an empty queue by creating an empty list. The push method adds an item to the end of the queue, while the pop method removes and returns the item at the front of the queue. The empty method checks if the queue is empty or not.

**Note**
- It's essential to understand that the Queue class does not have a size() method as shown in the test_queue function. This method is not implemented in the Queue class, but it can be easily calculated by using the len(self._data) expression.

**Output Example**
Creating and pushing items into a queue:
```python
q = Queue()
q.push('item1')
q.push('item2')
q.push('item3')
print(q._data)  # Output: ['item1', 'item2', 'item3']
```

Popping items from the queue:
```python
print(q.pop())  # Output: item1
print(q.pop())  # Output: item2
print(q.pop())  # Output: item3
print(q._data)  # Output: []
```

Checking if the queue is empty or not:
```python
print(q.empty())  # Output: True
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
 **__init__**
The function of `__init__` is to initialize a new Queue object.

**parameters**
This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**
Upon instantiation, an empty list named `_data` is created and assigned to the instance variable `self._data`. This list will be used to store the elements of the queue. The naming convention `_data` indicates that this variable should not be accessed directly by users of the class.

**Note**
- To interact with the Queue object, use methods such as `enqueue()`, `dequeue()`, and `peek()`. These methods will manipulate the data stored in the `self._data` list appropriately.
- The Queue class is defined elsewhere in the jobsNqueues.py module, so make sure to import it before using this function.
- When creating a new instance of the Queue class, do not call the `__init__` function explicitly as it will be called automatically when you create a new object with the `Queue()` constructor.

### FunctionDef push(self, item)
 **push**
The function of push is to add an item to the queue.

**parameters**
· `self`: The instance of the Queue class that this method belongs to.
· `item`: The data item to be added to the queue.

**Code Description**
This function appends the given item to the internal list of the Queue object, which represents the underlying data structure for the queue. This operation is performed in constant time O(1), making it efficient even when dealing with large numbers of items.

From a functional perspective, this method is used to enqueue (add) items to the queue. The order of insertion determines the order of removal from the queue, following the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

**Note**
The push function is essential for managing jobs or tasks in a job queue system, where multiple tasks are added and processed one at a time. In the project, this function is called by both the test_queue and test_job_queue functions to verify the correct behavior of the Queue class when dealing with different types of items (integers and Job objects). It's important to ensure that the push method works correctly to maintain the integrity and functionality of the job queue system.
***
### FunctionDef pop(self)
 **pop**
The function of pop is to remove and return the item at the front of the queue.

**parameters**
This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**
The `pop` function is defined within the `Queue` class. It removes the first item from the internal data structure (a list) that stores the items in the order they were added, and returns this removed item. The removal of an item affects the size and emptiness state of the queue.

**Note**
- Ensure that the queue is not empty before calling `pop`, as attempting to remove an item from an empty queue will raise an exception.
- The returned item can be any object, as the internal data structure does not enforce a specific type for the items in the queue.

**Output Example**
Assuming the queue contains the following items: [1, 2, 3], calling `pop` on this queue will return 1 and leave the queue with the remaining items: [2, 3].
***
### FunctionDef empty(self)
 **empty**
The function `empty` checks if the queue is empty or not.

**parameters**
This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**
The `empty` function returns `True` if the length of the data stored in the queue (self._data) is equal to 0, indicating that the queue is empty. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This function is useful for checking whether a queue contains any elements before performing operations on it.

**Note**
This function is an essential part of the Queue class in the project, as it allows users to verify if their queue is empty or not. It is typically called after creating a new queue or after removing elements from the queue using other functions like `push` and `pop`.

**Output Example**
If you call the `empty` function on an empty queue, it will return `True`. For example:
```python
queue = Queue()
print(queue.empty())  # Output: True
```

In the project, this function is called in the test_queue function located in tests.py. The test_queue function creates a new queue, checks if it's empty, adds an element to the queue, and then verifies that the queue is no longer empty. After removing an element from the queue, it again checks if the queue is empty using the `empty` function. This demonstrates the correct behavior of the Queue class and the `empty` function.

## ClassDef Job
 **Job**
The `Job` class is designed to represent a task that can be executed asynchronously. It takes a callable function as an argument, along with positional and keyword arguments to pass to this function when it's run.

**attributes**
- `_function`: The callable function representing the task to execute.
- `_args`: A tuple of positional arguments for the function.
- `_kwargs`: A dictionary of keyword arguments for the function.

**Code Description**
The `Job` class initializes a new job object with the provided function, arguments, and keywords. The `run()` method is used to execute the task by invoking the function with the specified arguments and keywords.

In the project, this class is utilized in the testing module (tests.py) for unit testing purposes. Specifically, it's called within the test_job and test_job_queue functions to create job instances and verify their behavior. The test_job function checks if the name and priority attributes of a newly created Job object are set correctly based on the provided arguments. The test_job_queue function demonstrates enqueuing multiple jobs into a Queue instance, then dequeues them in order of priority (higher priority jobs are processed first).

**Note**
- When creating a new job, ensure that the provided function is callable and properly defined.
- The order of jobs in a queue is determined by their priorities. Lower priority jobs will be processed after higher priority ones.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, function)
 **__init__**: The function of `__init__` is to initialize a new `Job` object.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
- `function`: A callable (a function or method) that represents the task to be executed by the Job instance.
- `*args`: Positional arguments to pass to the function when it is called.
- `**kwargs`: Keyword arguments to pass to the function when it is called.

**Code Description**: The `__init__` function initializes a new `Job` object by setting its attributes: `_function`, `_args`, and `_kwargs`. These attributes store the callable function, positional arguments, and keyword arguments respectively that are passed to the constructor when creating a new Job instance.

**Note**: When using this class, make sure that the provided function is callable (i.e., it should be a valid function or method). Also, keep in mind that the `_args` and `_kwargs` attributes will be used when calling the function associated with the Job instance later on.
***
### FunctionDef run(self)
 **run**: The function of `run` is to execute the task associated with an instance of the `Job` class.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any explicit parameters. However, it implicitly uses the instance variables `_function`, `_args`, and `_kwargs`.

- `self`: The instance of the `Job` class that invokes this function.
- `_function`: A callable object (function or method) representing the task to be executed.
- `_args`: A tuple of positional arguments for the callable object.
- `_kwargs`: A dictionary of keyword arguments for the callable object.

**Code Description**: The `run` function invokes the callable object (stored in `_function`) with the provided positional arguments (in `_args`) and keyword arguments (in `_kwargs`). This allows the task associated with a specific instance of the `Job` class to be executed.

**Note**: To use this function effectively, ensure that the `_function`, `_args`, and `_kwargs` instance variables are properly initialized before calling the `run` method on a `Job` object. The `_function` should be a callable object representing the task to be executed, while `_args` and `_kwargs` should contain the necessary arguments for that function or method.
