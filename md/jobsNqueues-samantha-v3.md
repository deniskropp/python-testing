## ClassDef Queue
 **Queue**
The function of Queue is to implement a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure that allows items to be added and removed from the end and the beginning of the list, respectively.

**attributes**
· `_data`: This is a list that stores the items in the queue. It is private and can only be accessed within the class.

**Code Description**
The Queue class initializes an empty list when created. The push method adds an item to the end of the list, while the pop method removes and returns the item at the beginning of the list. The empty method checks if the queue is empty by comparing the length of the list with zero.

**Note**
- It's essential to understand that the Queue class does not have a size attribute explicitly defined. However, you can determine the size of the queue by checking the length of the `_data` list.
- The order of items in the queue is maintained, and the item added last will be the first one to be removed (FIFO).

**Output Example**
Assuming we have a Queue object named 'q':
```
q = Queue()
q.push(1)
q.push(2)
print(q.pop())  # Output: 1
print(q.pop())  # Output: 2
```
In this example, the queue starts empty and then two items (1 and 2) are added to it. The pop method is called twice to remove and print the items in the order they were added (LIFO).
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
 **__init__**
The function of __init__ is to initialize a new Queue object.

**parameters**
This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**
When a new instance of the Queue class is created, the __init__ function is automatically called. Inside this function, an empty list named `_data` is initialized as an attribute of the newly created object. This list will be used to store the items in the queue. The underscore before the name indicates that it is a private attribute and should not be accessed directly from outside the class.

**Note**
This function initializes the Queue object with an empty list, allowing other functions within the Queue class to add, remove, and access items in the queue as needed. It's important to note that since this is a constructor, it should not be called explicitly by the user; instead, a new instance of the Queue class should be created using the syntax `Queue()`.

### FunctionDef push(self, item)
 **push**
The function of push is to add an item to the queue.

**parameters**
· `self`: The instance of the Queue class that this method belongs to.
· `item`: The data to be added to the queue. This can be any type of data, but it's typically used with objects.

**Code Description**
The push function appends the given item to the internal data structure (a list) of the Queue instance. This operation is performed in a way that maintains the order of insertion, ensuring that the first item added will be the first one to be removed from the queue when needed.

It's essential to understand that this function is part of the Queue class and can only be called on an instance of the Queue class. The Queue class is designed to handle operations related to queues, such as adding items (push), removing items (pop), checking if the queue is empty (empty), and getting the size of the queue (size).

**Note**
- The push function does not perform any validation on the item being added. It's up to the user to ensure that the item is in a suitable format before passing it to this function.
- The push function can be used with various data types, but it's typically used with objects like Job instances, as demonstrated in the test_job_queue function of tests.py. In such cases, it's crucial to implement an appropriate comparison mechanism when checking the equality of Job instances (e.g., comparing their names).
- The push function is a fundamental operation for managing queues and is often used in conjunction with other queue operations like pop and empty to create a complete workflow.

### FunctionDef pop(self)
 **pop**
The function of pop is to remove and return the item at the front of the queue.

**parameters**
This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**
The `pop` function removes an item from the beginning of the internal data structure (a list) that stores the items in the queue. It returns the removed item. The queue is implemented as a part of the Queue class, and this function can be called on any instance of the Queue class.

**Note**
The `pop` function will raise an exception if the queue is empty before being called. Make sure to check the emptiness of the queue before calling pop or handle the exception appropriately in your code.

**Example Output**
Assuming a queue with items [1, 2, 3], the output of `q.pop()` will be 1. After this call, the queue will contain [2, 3].

**Relationship with Callers in the Project**
The `pop` function is called by the test functions in both `tests.py/test_queue` and `tests.py/test_job_queue`. In the former case, it is used to verify that the queue correctly removes items from its front. In the latter case, it is used to dequeue jobs (represented as Job objects) from a job queue. The test function checks if the removed job has the expected name based on the order in which they were enqueued.
***
### FunctionDef empty(self)
 **empty**
The function `empty` checks if the queue is empty or not.

**parameters**
This function does not take any parameters. It only uses the instance of the Queue class (self).

**Code Description**
The `empty` function returns True if the number of items in the queue (stored in self._data) is equal to 0, and False otherwise. This allows users to check if their queue is empty before performing any operations on it.

**Note**
This function is crucial when dealing with queues as it helps manage the state of the data structure efficiently. It can be used in various scenarios such as checking if a queue needs more items added or if there are no more items to process.

**Example Output**
If you have an empty queue, calling `queue_instance.empty()` will return True. For example:
```python
my_queue = Queue()
print(my_queue.empty())  # Returns True
```

**Relationship with its callers in the project**
The `empty` function is called within the test suite (tests.py/test_queue) to verify that the queue correctly identifies whether it's empty or not. The test case checks if an initially empty queue returns True for the `empty()` method, and after adding an item to the queue, it should return False.

**Usage Example**
In your code, you can use the `empty` function like this:
```python
my_queue = Queue()
if my_queue.empty():
    print("The queue is empty.")
else:
    print("There are items in the queue.")
```

## ClassDef Job
 **Job**
The Job class is designed to represent a task or job that can be executed asynchronously. It takes a callable function and any number of arguments or keyword arguments to define the task.

**attributes**
- `_function`: The callable function that defines the task to be executed.
- `_args`: A tuple of positional arguments passed to the function when it is called.
- `_kwargs`: A dictionary of keyword arguments passed to the function when it is called.

**Code Description**
The Job class initializes a new job object with the provided callable function and any number of arguments or keyword arguments. The run method executes the task by calling the function with the specified arguments and keyword arguments.

In the context of this project, jobs are managed within queues (Queue class), which prioritize and execute jobs based on their priority. This allows for efficient management of multiple tasks that need to be executed concurrently or sequentially. The test_job and test_job_queue functions in tests.py demonstrate how to create a Job object and enqueue it in a Queue object, respectively.

**Note**
- When creating a Job object, ensure that the provided callable function is properly defined and can handle the specified arguments and keyword arguments.
- The order of jobs within a queue is determined by their priority. Lower priority jobs will be executed after higher priority jobs have been completed.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, function)
 **__init__**: The function of `__init__` is to initialize a new Job object.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
- `function (callable)`: This is the function to execute as the task. It should be callable, meaning it can be invoked with appropriate arguments and keywords.
- `*args`: These are positional arguments to pass to the function. They will be treated as a tuple if no arguments are provided when creating an instance of the Job object.
- `**kwargs`: These are keyword arguments to pass to the function. They will be treated as a dictionary if no keywords are provided when creating an instance of the Job object.

**Code Description**: The `__init__` function initializes a new Job object by assigning the provided function, positional arguments (args), and keyword arguments (kwargs) to appropriate attributes within the Job object. This allows for easy access and execution of the task function when needed.

**Note**: When creating a Job object, ensure that the provided function is callable. Also, be mindful of the order in which you pass your positional and keyword arguments as they will be directly assigned to the corresponding attributes within the Job object.
***
### FunctionDef run(self)
 **run**: The function of `run` is to execute the task associated with an instance of the `Job` class.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters directly. Instead, it calls another method (`_function`) using the self-object's attributes `_args` and `_kwargs`.

· `_args`: A tuple containing positional arguments to be passed to the called function.
· `_kwargs`: A dictionary containing keyword arguments to be passed to the called function.

**Code Description**: The `run` function is responsible for invoking the task associated with a specific instance of the `Job` class by calling the method `_function`. This method call is done using the self-object's attributes `_args` and `_kwargs`, which store the positional and keyword arguments, respectively, that should be passed to the called function.

**Note**: The `run` function assumes that the `_function` method has already been defined within the instance of the `Job` class, and it is responsible for executing the task associated with that specific job. It's essential to ensure that the `_function` method is correctly implemented and properly configured with the appropriate arguments before calling the `run` function.
