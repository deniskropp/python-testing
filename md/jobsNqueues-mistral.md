## ClassDef Queue
 **Queue**
The function of Queue is to implement a basic First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure that allows adding and removing items in a specific order.

**attributes**
Â· `_data`: A list that stores the items in the queue.

**Code Description**
The Queue class initializes an empty list when created. The push method appends an item to the end of the list, while the pop method removes and returns the first item from the list. The empty method checks if the list is empty or not.

This class serves as a fundamental building block for managing tasks in a sequential manner, ensuring that they are processed in the order they were added.

**Note**
- It's essential to understand that the Queue class operates on the principle of FIFO, meaning that the first item added will be the first one removed.
- The Queue class does not have a size method explicitly defined; however, you can calculate the size by subtracting the number of items in the queue from its maximum capacity (the length of the list).

**Output Example**
Assuming we have a Queue object `q` and push three items 'a', 'b', and 'c' into it:
```
q.push('a')
q.push('b')
q.push('c')
```
Now, if you pop items from the queue in order, you will get them back as follows:
```
assert q.pop() == 'b'
assert q.pop() == 'c'
assert q.pop() == 'a'
```
In the project, this Queue class is used in the tests.py module for testing purposes, where it demonstrates adding and removing items from the queue correctly. Additionally, a Job object is defined elsewhere in the code, which can be added to the Queue for processing tasks in a specific order.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
 **__init__**
The function of `__init__` is to initialize a new Queue object.

**parameters**
This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**
Upon initialization, an empty list named `_data` is created and assigned to the instance variable `self._data`. This list will be used to store the items in the queue. The underscore prefix indicates that this attribute should not be directly accessed or modified by users of the class.

**Note**
This function is automatically called when a new instance of the Queue class is created, so there's no need to call it explicitly. Keep in mind that the `_data` list is private and should not be accessed or manipulated directly from outside the class. Instead, use the provided methods like `enqueue()`, `dequeue()`, and `peek()` for adding, removing, and checking items in the queue respectively.
***
### FunctionDef push(self, item)
 **push** (in `Queue` class): This function is responsible for adding an item to the queue.

**parameters**:
- `self`: The instance of the Queue class that this function belongs to.
- `item`: The data item to be added to the queue.

**Code Description**: The push function appends the given item to the internal list (_data) of the Queue instance. This operation adds the item to the end of the queue, making it ready for dequeueing when required.

**Note**: It's essential to understand that the Queue data structure follows a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first item added to the queue will be the first one removed. In other words, the order of items in the queue is maintained, and the oldest item is processed before newer ones.

The push function plays a crucial role in the project as it allows adding jobs or any data items to the job queue for processing. This operation is used in both test_queue and test_job_queue functions within tests.py. In test_queue, the push function is called with an integer value, while in test_job_queue, it's called with Job objects containing a name and priority. The test functions verify that the queue behaves correctly after adding items using the push function.
***
### FunctionDef pop(self)
 **pop**
The function of pop is to remove and return the item at the front of the queue.

**parameters**
This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**
The `pop` function is defined within the `Queue` class. It removes the first item from the internal data structure (a list) that stores the items in the order they were added (FIFO - First In, First Out). The removed item is returned to the caller.

It's important to note that this operation modifies the queue by removing an item, so the size of the queue decreases by one after calling `pop`.

**Note**
- Ensure that you have called the `push` method before attempting to call `pop`, as an empty queue does not contain any items to remove.
- The order of the items in the queue is maintained, with the item added first being the first one removed (FIFO).

**Output Example**
Assuming a queue contains the following items: [1, 2, 3], calling `pop` on this queue will return 1 and leave the queue as [2, 3].
***
### FunctionDef empty(self)
 **empty**
The function `empty` checks if the queue is empty or not.

**parameters**
This function does not take any parameters. It only accesses the internal data of the queue object (`self._data`).

**Code Description**
The `empty` function returns a boolean value indicating whether the queue is empty or not. It achieves this by comparing the length of the internal data list (`self._data`) to zero. If the length is equal to zero, it means the queue is empty and the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

**Note**
This function is essential for checking if a queue contains any elements before performing operations like dequeuing or resizing. It's important to understand that this function does not modify the state of the queue in any way.

**Output Example**
If the queue is empty, the function will return True; otherwise, it will return False. For example:
```python
queue = Queue()  # An empty queue
print(queue.empty())  # Output: True
```

**Relationship with its callers in the project**
The `empty` function is called by the test suite (tests.py/test_queue) to verify the correct behavior of the queue object when it's empty and after adding elements to it. The test suite ensures that the queue functions correctly under various conditions, such as checking if an empty queue returns True for the `empty()` function call.
***
## ClassDef Job
 **Job**
The `Job` class is designed to represent a task that can be executed asynchronously. It takes a callable function and arguments to define the task and its parameters.

**attributes**
- `function`: The callable function that defines the task to be executed.
- `args`: A tuple of positional arguments to pass to the function when it is called.
- `kwargs`: A dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to the function when it is called.

**Code Description**
The `Job` class initializes a new job object with the provided function, arguments, and keywords. It stores these parameters internally for later use. The `run()` method executes the task by calling the stored function with the provided arguments and keywords.

**Note**
- To create a new job, instantiate the `Job` class with the desired function, arguments, and keywords. For example:
```python
job = Job(my_function, arg1, arg2, kwarg1='value1', kwarg2='value2')
```
- To execute the task represented by a job object, call its `run()` method. The function will be executed with the provided arguments and keywords. For example:
```python
job.run()
```
- The jobs are typically managed within a queue system, where they can be added, removed, and processed in an orderly fashion. This is demonstrated in the `tests.py/test_job_queue` module, where jobs are added to a queue and then popped out in the correct order based on their priority (which is not explicitly set for the jobs in this example).
### FunctionDef __init__(self, function)
 **__init__**: The function of `__init__` is to initialize a new Job object.

**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
- `function (callable)`: This is the function that will be executed as the task for the Job object. It should be a callable, meaning it can be called like a function or method.
- `*args`: These are positional arguments to pass to the function when it is called. They are optional and can be used if the function being called requires them.
- `**kwargs`: These are keyword arguments to pass to the function when it is called. They are also optional, but can be useful for passing named arguments to the function.

**Code Description**: The `__init__` function initializes a new Job object by storing the provided function, positional arguments (args), and keyword arguments (kwargs) as instance variables on the object. This allows the function, along with its required arguments, to be easily accessed later when the Job needs to be executed.

**Note**: When creating a new Job object, make sure that the provided function is callable. If you are passing arguments to the function, ensure they match the expected number and type of arguments for the function being called. Misuse or incorrect use of this function may lead to unexpected behavior or errors when executing the Job.
***
### FunctionDef run(self)
 **run**: The function of `run` is to execute the task associated with an instance of the Job class.

**parameters**: This Function does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it calls another method (`_function`) using the self object's attributes `_args` and `_kwargs`.

- `self._args`: A tuple or list of positional arguments to be passed to the called function.
- `self._kwargs`: A dictionary containing keyword arguments to be passed to the called function.

**Code Description**: The `run` function is a method in the Job class that invokes another method (`_function`) with the specified arguments and keywords. This allows for a more modular design, as the specific task execution can be abstracted away from the main `run` function.

**Note**: When using this code, ensure that the `_function` method is properly implemented in the Job class to perform the desired task. Additionally, make sure that the `_args` and `_kwargs` attributes are set before calling the `run` function.
