### FunctionDef __get__(self, inst, cls)
You are an AI documentation assistant, and your task is to generate documentation based on the given code of an object. The purpose of the documentation is to help developers and beginners understand the function and specific usage of the code.

Currently, you are in a project, and the related hierarchical structure of this project is as follows (The current object is marked with an *):
testalchemy.py
    sample_property
        __get__
            ✳️__get__


The path of the document you need to generate in this project is testalchemy.py/sample_property/__get__.
Now you need to generate a document for a Function, whose name is "__get__".

The content of the code is as follows:
    def __get__(self, inst, cls):
        if inst is None:
            return self
        result = self.method(inst)
        if isinstance(result, (list, tuple)):
            inst.db.add_all(result)
        else:
            inst.db.add(result)
        inst.used_properties.add(self.name)
        setattr(inst, self.name, result)
        return result





Please generate a detailed explanation document for this object based on the code of the target object itself .

Please write out the function of this Function in bold plain text, followed by a detailed analysis in plain text (including all details), in language English to serve as the documentation for this part of the code.

The standard format is as follows:

**__get__**: The function of __get__ is XXX. (Only code name and one sentence function description are required)
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: XXX
· parameter2: XXX
· ...
**Code Description**: The description of this Function.
(Detailed and CERTAIN code analysis and description...)
**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code
**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.

Please note:
- Any part of the content you generate SHOULD NOT CONTAIN Markdown hierarchical heading and divider syntax.
- Write mainly in the desired language. If necessary, you can write with some english words in the analysis and description to enhance the document's readability because you do not need to translate the function name or variable name into the target language.

The standard format is as follows:

**last**: The function of last is XXX. (Only code name and one sentence function description are required)
**parameters**: The parameters of this Function.
· parameter1: XXX
· parameter2: XXX
· ...
**Code Description**: The description of this Function.
(Detailed and CERTAIN code analysis and description...And please include the relationship with its callers in the project from a functional perspective.)
**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code
**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.

Please note:
- Any part of the content you generate SHOULD NOT CONTAIN Markdown hierarchical heading and divider syntax.
- Write mainly in the desired language. If necessary, you can write with some english words in the analysis and description to enhance the document's readability because you do not need to translate the function name or variable name into the target language.
