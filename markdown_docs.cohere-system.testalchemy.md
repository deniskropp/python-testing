## ClassDef sample_property
**sample_property**: This class is used to create custom properties for classes, providing a way to define and access dynamic attributes. 

**attributes**: 
- `method`: The method that will be used to generate the value of the property. 
- `name`: The name of the property. If not provided, it will default to the name of the `method`. 

**Code Description**: The `sample_property` class allows you to create dynamic properties for your classes. When accessed, the `method` associated with the property is called, and its result is returned. This enables you to define computed properties or properties that require additional processing. 

The class also handles the case where the `method` returns a list or tuple. In such cases, it adds the returned values to the `db` of the instance, providing a convenient way to manage and store related data. 

Additionally, the `sample_property` class keeps track of the used properties by adding their names to the `used_properties` set of the instance. This can be useful for various purposes, such as debugging or understanding the state of an object. 

**Note**: The `sample_property` class is designed to be used as a descriptor, and it follows the descriptor protocol by implementing the `__get__` and `__set__` methods. This allows it to control the access and modification of the properties it defines. 

**Output Example**: 
```python
class MyClass:
    def method(self):
        return "Hello, World!"

    prop = sample_property(method)

instance = MyClass()
print(instance.prop)  # Output: Hello, World!
```

In this example, the `sample_property` class is used to create a custom property `prop` for the `MyClass` class. The `method` defined within `MyClass` is used to generate the value of the `prop` property. When accessed, the `method` is called, and its return value is stored and returned as the value of `prop`.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, method, name)
**__init__**: The function **__init__** initializes a sample property object. 

**parameters**: The parameters for the **__init__** function are:

- **self**: The instance of the class, allowing access to other methods and properties within the class.
- **method**: The parameter that represents the method or function being inspected. It can be any callable object, such as a function or a lambda function.
- **name**: An optional string parameter that allows you to specify a custom name for the sample property. If not provided, the name of the **method** will be used as the default.

**Code Description**: This function initializes the sample property object by setting the **method** attribute to the provided **method** parameter. It also sets the **__doc__** attribute of the sample property object to the documentation string (**__doc__**) of the provided **method**. This is useful for inheriting documentation from the underlying method. Additionally, it sets the **name** attribute to either the provided **name** parameter or, if not specified, to the name of the **method** (**method.__name__**).

**Note**: The **__init__** function is a fundamental part of creating objects in Python, and it is called automatically when an object is created from a class. It allows you to set up the initial state of an object by initializing its attributes. In this case, it is used to configure the sample property object with the provided method and name.
***
### FunctionDef __get__(self, inst, cls)
**__get__**: The function **__get__** is used to retrieve the value of a property, taking into account the instance and class it belongs to, and performing additional operations specific to this project.

**parameters**:
- self: A common parameter referring to the instance of the current class.
- inst: The instance for which the property value is being accessed.
- cls: The class of the instance, "inst."

**Code Description**: This function first checks if the "inst" parameter is None, and if so, it returns "self." This is a common Pythonic approach to allow access to attributes or methods of a class itself, without needing an instance. If "inst" is not None, the function proceeds to calculate and retrieve the property value. It calls "self.method(inst)" to obtain a result, which could be a list or a tuple of objects or a single object. 

Then, depending on the type of "result," it adds the objects to the "inst.db" attribute. If "result" is a list or tuple, it uses "inst.db.add_all(result)" to add all the objects. Otherwise, it uses "inst.db.add(result)" to add a single object. This suggests that "inst.db" might be some kind of collection or database specific to this project. 

The function then updates the "used_properties" set of the instance, adding the name of the property being accessed. This could be used to track which properties have been accessed or modified. Finally, it sets the attribute of the instance with the name of the property being accessed ("self.name") to the calculated "result," and returns this "result."

**Note**: This function appears to be specific to the project and includes custom behavior related to the "db" attribute and property tracking. It combines property access with additional operations, which is an unconventional use of the "__get__" method in Python.

**Output Example**: When accessing a property, "my_property," of an instance, "my_instance," the function would return the calculated value and perform the additional operations. For example, if "self.method(inst)" returns a list of objects, "[obj1, obj2, obj3]," the function would add these objects to "inst.db," update "inst.used_properties," set "my_instance.my_property" to the list, and return "[obj1, obj2, obj3]."
***
### FunctionDef __call__(self, obj)
**__call__**: This function is used to invoke the "method" of the instance, passing the "obj" as an argument.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- obj: The object that will be passed as an argument to the "method."

**Code Description**: The  **__call__**  function allows an instance of a class to be invoked as if it were a callable function. In this case, when you call the instance, it will, in turn, call its  "method"  function, passing the provided  "obj"  as an argument. This is a convenient way to create a wrapper or proxy around a method, allowing you to modify or extend its behavior without changing the original method's code.

**Note**: The  **__call__**  method is a special method in Python that allows instances of a class to be called like a function. It provides a way to overload the behavior of calling an instance and is useful for creating objects that mimic functions or for adding a layer of processing when an instance is invoked.

**Output Example**: When you call an instance of a class with this  **__call__**  method, it will invoke the underlying  "method"  with the provided  "obj"  argument. For example, if you have a class  "MyClass"  with this  **__call__**  method and a "method"  that returns the square of a number, you can call it like this:

```python
instance = MyClass()
result = instance(5)
print(result)  # Output: 25
```

In this example, the  **__call__**  method of the  "instance"  is invoked with the argument 5, which then calls the  "method"  with the same argument, returning the square of 5, which is 25.
***
## ClassDef Sample
**Sample**: The function of Sample is to provide a base class for creating and managing samples or test data, with support for various features like property decoration, method overriding, and database transactions. 

**attributes**: 
- __metaclass__: A metaclass that automatically decorates methods with the 'sample_property' decorator. It iterates through the class attributes, identifies methods, and wraps them with the decorator, providing additional functionality to the base class. 
- db: Represents the database connection or session used for managing transactions. It can be initialized with a ScopedSession, in which case the actual database session is extracted using the 'registry()' method. 
- used_properties: A set used to track the properties that have been utilized or accessed during the creation process. 
- kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that can be passed during the initialization of the Sample class, which are then updated to the instance's dictionary. 

**Code Description**: The Sample class serves as a foundation for creating test data or samples, providing a structured way to define and manage related data. It offers a unique metaclass that automatically decorates methods with the 'sample_property' decorator, enhancing their functionality. This allows for easy method overriding, as demonstrated in some of the test cases. 

The class also handles database transactions by providing the 'create_all' method, which iterates through the class attributes and invokes their respective methods. This ensures that any defined data creation methods are executed within a database transaction, allowing for atomic operations. 

Additionally, the Sample class supports the use of ScopedSession to manage database connections. If a ScopedSession is provided during initialization, it extracts the actual database session using the 'registry()' method, ensuring proper transaction handling. 

**Note**: The Sample class and its derived test cases do not include any explicit database operations or connections. The 'create_all' method and the 'db' attribute suggest database interaction, but the actual implementation is missing. 

**Output Example**: When creating a subclass of Sample, such as 'DataSample', and defining methods like 'john', 'cat1', etc., the output would be the creation of the respective data objects within a database transaction. For example: 

```python
class DataSample(Sample):
    def john(self):
        return User(name='john')

    def cat1(self):
        return Category(name='cat1')

    # ... other methods ...

# Creating a DataSample instance and invoking the create_all method
data_sample = DataSample(db_session)
data_sample.create_all()

# Output: Within the database transaction
# User(name='john')
# Category(name='cat1')
# ... corresponding data objects for other methods ...
```

The output would result in the creation of the 'john' user, 'cat1' category, and other defined data objects within the database, all within a single transaction.
### ClassDef __metaclass__
**__metaclass__**: The function of __metaclass__ is to modify the attributes of the class it is applied to, specifically targeting method-related attributes.

**attributes**:
· cls: The class to which the metaclass belongs.
· cls_name: The name of the class being created.
· bases: The base classes of the class being created.
· attributes: The dictionary of attributes for the class being created.

**Code Description**: The __metaclass__ class is a custom metaclass that inherits from the built-in 'type' metaclass. It modifies the behavior of class creation by intercepting the class creation process and modifying the class attributes.

During class creation, the __new__ method of the metaclass is called. It first creates the class using the type.__new__ method, providing the class name, bases, and attributes. Then, it iterates over the attributes of the newly created class and identifies attributes that are method-related (excluding attributes starting with an underscore and the 'create_all' attribute).

For each method-related attribute, the metaclass checks its type and performs the following actions:
1. If the attribute is a method (instance method), it extracts the underlying function using 'im_func' and creates a new 'sample_property' attribute with the extracted function and the original attribute name.
2. If the attribute is a 'sample_property' (a custom descriptor, presumably), and its name does not match the attribute name, it updates the 'sample_property' with the correct name.
3. For other types of method-related attributes (e.g., classmethod, staticmethod), no action is taken.

By using this metaclass, any method-related attributes of the class will be automatically wrapped with the 'sample_property' descriptor. This allows for additional behavior or customization to be applied to method calls.

**Note**: The code assumes the existence of a 'sample_property' descriptor class, which is not provided in the given code snippet. The behavior of 'sample_property' and its interaction with the metaclass are crucial to understanding the full impact of this metaclass.

**Output Example**: When the __metaclass__ is applied to a class, the resulting class will have its method-related attributes modified. For instance, if we have a class 'MyClass' with a method 'my_method', applying this metaclass would result in 'my_method' being wrapped with the 'sample_property' descriptor. The actual output would depend on the implementation of 'sample_property' and its effect on method calls.
#### FunctionDef __new__(cls, cls_name, bases, attributes)
**__new__**: The function overrides the default behavior of creating a new instance of the metaclass.

**parameters**:
- cls: The class to which the new instance will belong.
- cls_name: The name of the class being created.
- bases: A tuple of base classes for the new class.
- attributes: A dictionary of attributes and methods for the new class.

**Code Description**: This function is responsible for creating a new instance of the metaclass, which will become a new class. It first creates a new class using the provided cls, cls_name, and bases arguments by calling the type function. Then, it iterates over the attributes of the new class and identifies methods and sample_property instances. For methods, it extracts the underlying function (new_value) using im_func. For sample_property instances, it retrieves the associated method and assigns it to new_value as well. This separation allows for consistent handling of both types. The function then re-assigns these new values to the class using setattr, ensuring that the class's methods and sample_properties are properly configured. Finally, the function returns the newly created class instance (self).

The purpose of this metescaling is to facilitate the creation of classes with specific attributes and methods, providing a level of abstraction and customization. By using sample_property, methods can be associated with dynamic attributes, enabling computed properties and additional processing.

**Note**: The function assumes that the provided arguments (cls, cls_name, bases, and attributes) are valid and correctly structured. It also relies on the presence and proper implementation of the sample_property class and its methods.

**Output Example**:
```python
# Assuming the Sample class is defined elsewhere
class MyClass(Sample):
    def my_method(self):
        # Method implementation
        pass

    prop = sample_property(my_method)

# The __new__ function creates a new class instance (MyClass) with the specified attributes
# The resulting class has the my_method method and the prop sample_property
```
***
***
### FunctionDef __init__(self, db)
**__init__**: The function initializes a Sample object.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the Sample class.
- db: The database connection or a ScopedSession object. If a ScopedSession is provided, it is converted to a registry using the .registry() method.
- kwargs: Optional keyword arguments that are used to update the instance's dictionary (__dict__). These can be used to set additional attributes on the Sample object during initialization.

**Code Description**: This method is called when a new Sample object is created. It takes care of initializing the object's attributes, ensuring the database connection is properly set up, and handling any additional keyword arguments passed during instantiation.

The db parameter is specifically checked to see if it is an instance of ScopedSession. If it is, the .registry() method is called on it to retrieve the underlying database registry. This ensures that the Sample object always has a valid database connection or registry assigned to it.

The used_properties attribute is initialized as an empty set. This attribute likely keeps track of the properties or attributes that have been utilized or accessed on the Sample object.

Finally, the __dict__ of the instance is updated with the provided kwargs. This allows additional attributes to be set on the Sample object during initialization, providing flexibility in configuring the object's state.

**Note**: The __init__ method is a critical part of the Sample class as it sets up the initial state of the object, including the database connection, which is likely to be used throughout the object's lifetime.
***
### FunctionDef create_all(self)
**create_all**: The function is used to create and persist objects in a database session. 

**parameters**: This function does not take any explicit parameters. 

**Code Description**: The `create_all` function is a method of the `Sample` class and is responsible for creating and persisting objects in a database session. It first checks if the database connection (`self.db`) is set to autocommit. If it is, the function begins a transaction using `self.db.begin()`. This ensures that multiple operations are treated as a single unit of work, maintaining data consistency. 

The function then uses the `map` function to iterate over the directory of the `Sample` class (`dir(self)`). For each name in the directory, it calls the corresponding method on the `Sample` instance using `getattr(self, name)`. This allows for the creation of objects and their relationships. 

Finally, the function commits the transaction using `self.db.commit()` to persist the changes to the database. 

This function is used in multiple test cases within the `tests.py` module to create sample data and assert expected database query results. For example, in `test_sample_creation`, a `DataSample` class is defined, inheriting from `Sample`. The `create_all` function is then called on an instance of `DataSample`, and assertions are made to verify the expected data in the database session. Similar usage is seen in other test cases, such as `test_sample_creation_with_scoped_session`, `test_sample_creation_with_autocommit`, etc. 

**Note**: This function assumes that the methods within the `Sample` class are responsible for creating the necessary objects and their relationships. It relies on the correct implementation of these methods to ensure valid data creation and persistence.
***
## ClassDef Restorable
**Restorable**: The function of Restorable is to provide a context manager for database transactions, allowing for easy rollback and restoration of the database state. 

**Attributes**: 
- `db`: The database connection or session to be managed. 
- `watch`: An optional parameter specifying the object to watch for flush events. If not provided, it defaults to the `db`. 
- `history`: A dictionary that tracks the identities of instances added during the managed context. 

**Code Description**: 
The `Restorable` class is designed to manage database transactions, providing a way to roll back changes and restore the database to its initial state. It is used as a context manager, typically with a `with` statement, to enclose a block of code that interacts with the database. 

When initialized, `Restorable` takes a `db` parameter, which can be a database connection or a `ScopedSession`. If a `ScopedSession` is provided, it is converted to a registry. The `watch` parameter specifies the object that triggers the 'after_flush' event, which is used to track changes. 

The `__enter__` method sets up an event listener on the `watch` object, listening for the 'after_flush' event. This allows `Restorable` to track changes made to the database during the managed context. 

The `__exit__` method performs the rollback and restoration process. It rolls back the transaction, expunges all instances, and then manually deletes any instances added during the managed context. It achieves this by iterating over the `history` dictionary, which contains the class and identity of each added instance. After deleting the instances, it commits and closes the database connection. 

The `after_flush` method is triggered when the 'after_flush' event is emitted. It updates the `history` dictionary by adding the class and identity of any new instances created during the flush. 

**Note**: 
- The `Restorable` class provides a convenient way to manage database transactions, ensuring that any changes made within the managed context can be easily rolled back. 
- It is particularly useful in testing scenarios, as demonstrated in the `tests.py` file, where it is used to test the behavior of database interactions. 
- The class relies on the 'after_flush' event to track changes, so it is important to ensure that the watched object emits this event correctly. 
- The `history` dictionary is used to store the identities of instances, allowing for their deletion during the rollback process. 

In the `tests.py` file, the `Restorable` class is used in multiple test cases to ensure that database interactions behave as expected. For example, in `test_restorable_and_normal_behavior`, it is used to test that adding and committing instances does not persist them in the database. Similarly, in `test_restorable_with_autocommit`, it demonstrates the expected behavior when using a database session with autocommit enabled. 

The `Restorable` class provides a valuable tool for managing database transactions and ensuring the ability to restore the database state, making it easier to test and manage complex database interactions.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, db, watch)
**__init__**: Initialize a Restorable object with database connectivity and optional watch configuration.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the Restorable object.
- db: The database connection or a ScopedSession object. If a ScopedSession is provided, it is converted to a registry for further use.
- watch: Optional. The database to watch for changes. If not provided, it defaults to the 'db' parameter value.

**Code Description**: This method initializes the Restorable object with the necessary database connectivity and configuration. It takes a 'db' parameter, which can be a database connection or a ScopedSession object. If a ScopedSession is provided, it is converted to a registry using the 'registry()' method, allowing access to the underlying database connection. The 'db' parameter is then stored as an attribute of the Restorable object.

The 'watch' parameter determines the database to observe for changes. If it is not provided, the 'db' parameter value is used as the default. This 'watch' configuration is stored as an attribute, ensuring the Restorable object can monitor the specified database for any modifications.

Additionally, an empty dictionary named 'history' is initialized as an attribute. This dictionary likely serves as a container to store the history of changes or operations performed on the database, enabling the Restorable object to keep track of modifications and potentially provide rollback or restoration functionality.

**Note**: The Restorable object appears to be designed for database interaction and change tracking. Ensure that the 'db' parameter provides a valid database connection or a ScopedSession that can be converted to access the underlying database. The 'watch' parameter allows for specific database monitoring, which can be useful for change detection and subsequent restoration or rollback operations.
***
### FunctionDef __enter__(self)
**__enter__**: This function is used to set up an event listener for the 'after_flush' event, which is a part of the Restorable context management protocol. 

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the Restorable class.

**Code Description**: 
The __enter__ function is a component of the Restorable context management protocol. When called, it sets up an event listener for the 'after_flush' event by invoking the event.listen method. This event listener is associated with the after_flush function, which is defined within the same class.

The purpose of this function is to ensure that the after_flush function is executed after a flush operation. By setting up this event listener, the Restorable class can track and manage database changes efficiently.

The after_flush function, which is triggered by the 'after_flush' event, plays a crucial role in capturing the identities of new instances added to the database during a flush operation. It iterates over these new instances, extracts their class and identifier, and stores this information in the self.history attribute for efficient tracking and subsequent cleanup operations.

**Note**: The __enter__ function is a critical step in the Restorable context management protocol. It ensures that the necessary event listener is set up to invoke the after_flush function, allowing for reliable tracking and management of database changes within the context of the Restorable class.
***
### FunctionDef __exit__(self, type, value, traceback)
**__exit__**: The function is responsible for performing cleanup operations when exiting a context managed by the Restorable class.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the Restorable class.
- type: The type of the exception that occurred, or None if the context was exited normally.
- value: The exception object that was raised, or None if no exception occurred.
- traceback: The traceback object that provides information about the exception's origin, or None if no exception occurred.

**Code Description**:
The __exit__ function is a part of the context management protocol implemented by the Restorable class. It is called when exiting the context managed by the Restorable class, either due to an exception or normal completion. The function performs the following cleanup operations:
1. **Rollback and Expunging**: It starts by rolling back any pending transactions in the database (db.rollback()) and expunging all instances from the session (db.expunge_all()). This ensures that any changes made within the context are discarded.
2. **Autoflush Handling**: The autoflush setting of the database is temporarily disabled (db.autoflush = False) to prevent any automatic flushing of changes during the cleanup process. If the database is in autocommit mode, a new transaction is started (db.begin()) to ensure subsequent operations are properly managed.
3. **Instance Deletion**: The function then iterates over the self.history dictionary, which contains the class-identifier pairs of instances added during the context. For each class and identifier, it retrieves the corresponding instance from the database (db.query(cls).get(ident)). If the instance exists, it is deleted from the database (db.delete(instance)). This ensures that any instances created within the context are removed.
4. **Commit and Close**: After deleting the instances, the changes are committed to the database (db.commit()), and the database connection is closed (db.close()).
5. **Restoring Autoflush**: Finally, the autoflush setting is restored to its original value (db.autoflush = old_autoflush).

Additionally, the function removes the event listener for the 'after_flush' event, which was set up by the __enter__ method. This ensures that the after_flush function is no longer triggered when a flush operation occurs.

**Note**: The __exit__ function is crucial for ensuring that any changes made within the context of the Restorable class are properly rolled back and cleaned up. It guarantees that the database remains consistent and that any temporary instances are removed upon exiting the context.
***
### FunctionDef after_flush(self, db, flush_context, instances)
**after_flush**: The function is used to track the identities of new instances added to the database during a flush operation.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- db: The database connection or session.
- flush_context: The context of the flush operation.
- instances=None: Optional, a collection of instances to flush. If not provided, all new instances in the db.new collection are considered.

**Code Description**:
The after_flush function is a part of the Restorable context management protocol. It is called by the __enter__ method of the Restorable class, which sets up an event listener for the 'after_flush' event, associating it with the after_flush function.

Inside the after_flush function, it iterates over the new instances added to the database during the flush operation (db.new). For each instance, it extracts the class and identifier using the util.identity_key function. These class-identifier pairs are then stored in the self.history attribute, which is a dictionary. The history dictionary is organized with the class as the key and a set of identifiers as the value. This allows for efficient tracking of instances by their class.

The function ensures that the identities of new instances are recorded in the history attribute, which is later used by the __exit__ method of the Restorable class. The __exit__ method performs cleanup operations, including deleting the instances that were added during the flush operation. It iterates over the self.history dictionary and retrieves the corresponding instances from the database using the class and identifier. If an instance exists, it is deleted from the database.

**Note**: The after_flush function is a crucial part of the Restorable context management protocol, ensuring that the identities of new instances are captured for subsequent cleanup operations. It works in conjunction with the __enter__ and __exit__ methods to provide a reliable way to track and manage database changes within a specific context.
***
## ClassDef DBHistory
**DBHistory**: The function of DBHistory is to track and assert changes made to a database session, including creations, updates, and deletions of records. 

**attributes**: 
- session: The database session being tracked. 
- _target: The target session or registry, depending on whether the session is scoped. 
- _created, _updated, _deleted: Sets to track the instances of created, updated, and deleted objects, respectively. 
- created_idents, updated_idents, deleted_idents: Dictionaries to store the identities of created, updated, and deleted objects, keyed by their model class. 

**Code Description**: 
The DBHistory class is designed to monitor and assert changes made to a database session. It keeps track of created, updated, and deleted objects, providing methods to retrieve and assert the state of these changes. 

When initialized with a session, DBHistory sets up event listeners to monitor the session's 'after_flush', 'after_commit', and 'after_soft_rollback' events. It maintains sets and dictionaries to store the instances and identities of changed objects, respectively. 

The 'last' method retrieves the last changed objects of a specific type (created, updated, or deleted) for a given model class. The 'assert_' methods allow for assertions on the presence of changed objects, with the ability to specify an identity. 

The 'assert_one' method is used to assert that only one instance of a changed object exists and returns that instance. 

The 'clear' method resets the history by clearing the identity dictionaries, while 'clear_cache' clears the sets tracking changed instances. 

The context manager interface, implemented through __enter__ and __exit__, ensures that event listeners are set up and removed appropriately when using DBHistory in a 'with' statement. 

The '_after_flush' method updates the sets tracking changed instances based on the db.new, db.dirty, and db.deleted sets. 

The '_after_commit' method populates the identity dictionaries with the identities of changed objects and clears the cache. 

The '_after_rollback' method clears the cache. 

**Note**: DBHistory relies on the 'util.identity_key' function to generate identities for objects. 

**Output Example**: 
Here is an example of how DBHistory can be used: 

```python
session = Session()
with DBHistory(session) as history:
    user = User(name='test')
    session.add(user)
    session.commit()

# Assert that a user was created
history.assert_created(User)
history.assert_created(User, user.id)
history.assert_created_one(User)

# Get the last created user
last_created = history.last_created(User)

# Clear the history
history.clear()
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, session)
**__init__**: Initialize the DBHistory class.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the DBHistory class.
- session: The database session to be associated with the DBHistory instance. It can be either a Session or a ScopedSession object.

**Code Description**:
This method initializes the DBHistory class by asserting that the provided 'session' parameter is an instance of either Session or ScopedSession. It then sets the 'session' as an attribute of the instance, allowing subsequent methods to access and interact with the database session.

The '_target' attribute is set to the provided session, but if the session is a ScopedSession, '_target' is updated to the session's registry(). This distinction is made to ensure that the correct underlying session is used for subsequent operations.

The method also initializes several sets and dictionaries to track created, updated, and deleted entities. These data structures are used to keep track of the state of the database and identify changes made during a session.

- _created: A set that likely tracks the created entities.
- _deleted: A set that likely tracks the deleted entities.
- _updated: A set that likely tracks the updated entities.
- created_idents, updated_idents, deleted_idents: Dictionaries likely used to store additional information about the created, updated, and deleted entities, respectively.

**Note**:
The purpose of the DBHistory class and the specific usage of these data structures are not entirely clear from the provided code snippet. However, it appears that this class is designed to track and manage changes made to the database during a session, potentially providing a history or audit log of entity creations, updates, and deletions.
***
### FunctionDef last(self, model_cls, mode)
**last**: The function retrieves the set of identities of a given model class that were last created, updated, or deleted. 

**parameters**: 
- self: The instance of the class. 
- model_cls: The model class for which the last identities are retrieved. 
- mode: A string indicating the type of operation; either 'created', 'updated', or 'deleted'. 

**Code Description**: 
The 'last' function is a method of the 'DBHistory' class and is used to access the identities of the specified model class that were last modified in a particular way. The function first asserts that the provided 'mode' is one of the three accepted values: 'created', 'updated', or 'deleted'. It then uses the 'getattr' function to dynamically access the attribute named after the provided 'mode' appended with "_idents". For example, if 'mode' is 'created', it accesses the 'created_idents' attribute. The value associated with the provided 'model_cls' is then retrieved from the set and returned. 

This function is called by other methods within the same class: 'last_created', 'last_updated', and 'last_deleted', which use it to retrieve the last identities for the respective modes. The 'assert_' method also uses 'last' to retrieve the identities based on the provided 'mode' and then performs additional assertions on the result. 

**Note**: 
- The 'last' function relies on the dynamic attribute access using 'getattr' to retrieve the appropriate set of identities based on the provided 'mode'. 
- The 'model_cls' parameter is used to specify the model class for which the last identities are retrieved. 

**Output Example**: 
Assuming the following class attributes: 
```python
created_idents = {'ModelA': {1, 2, 3}, 'ModelB': {4, 5}}
updated_idents = {'ModelA': {2, 3}, 'ModelB': {5, 6}}
deleted_idents = {'ModelA': {1}, 'ModelB': {}}
```

Calling the 'last' function with different parameters could yield the following results: 
```python
last(self, ModelA, 'created')  # Output: {1, 2, 3}
last(self, ModelB, 'updated')  # Output: {5, 6}
last(self, ModelA, 'deleted')  # Output: {1}
```

### FunctionDef _idents_to_objects_set(self, idents, model_cls)
**_idents_to_objects_set**: The function **_idents_to_objects_set** retrieves a set of objects corresponding to the provided identifiers (idents) for a given model class (model_cls) from the database session.

**parameters**:
- idents: A collection of identifiers for which the corresponding objects need to be retrieved.
- model_cls: The model class for which the objects need to be fetched.

**Code Description**: This function, **_idents_to_objects_set**, is a utility function used within the DBHistory class to facilitate object retrieval based on identifiers. It utilizes the session's query function (q) to perform the retrieval operation. The function iterates over the provided identifiers and uses the get method on the query object to fetch the corresponding object for each identifier. The result is returned as a set, ensuring uniqueness and eliminating duplicates.

This function is leveraged by other methods within the DBHistory class, such as last_created, last_updated, assert_created, and assert_updated. These methods rely on **_idents_to_objects_set** to retrieve objects based on specific criteria, such as the last created or updated object, or to perform assertions on the existence of objects with particular identifiers.

**Note**: The function assumes that the provided identifiers are valid and exist in the database. It does not handle cases where an identifier is missing or incorrect.

**Output Example**:
```python
idents = [1, 2, 3, 4]
model_cls = MyModel
result = _idents_to_objects_set(idents, model_cls)
print(result)
# Output: {<MyModel object at 0x...>, <MyModel object at 0x...>, ...}
```

In the example above, **_idents_to_objects_set** is called with a list of identifiers [1, 2, 3, 4] and a model class MyModel. It retrieves the corresponding objects for each identifier and returns them as a set. The output shows a set containing instances of MyModel, with each object having a unique memory address.
***
### FunctionDef last_created(self, model_cls)
**last_created**: The function retrieves the set of objects that were last created for a given model class. 

**parameters**: 
- self: The instance of the class. 
- model_cls: The model class for which the last created objects are retrieved. 

**Code Description**: 
The 'last_created' function is a method within the 'DBHistory' class. It is used to access the set of objects of a specified model class that were most recently created. The function first calls the 'last' method with the provided 'model_cls' and the mode set to 'created'. This retrieves the identities of the last created objects for the given model class. The '_idents_to_objects_set' method is then called with these identities and the 'model_cls' to fetch the corresponding objects from the database session. The result is a set of objects that were last created for the specified model class. 

This function is utilized in the test suite, specifically in the 'tests.py' file, to verify the expected behavior of the 'DBHistory' class. In the test cases, 'last_created' is called with a 'User' model class to assert that the set of last created users matches the expected output. 

**Note**: 
- The 'last_created' function relies on the 'last' and '_idents_to_objects_set' methods to retrieve the desired information. 
- The 'model_cls' parameter is essential to specify the model class for which the last created objects are retrieved. 

**Output Example**: 
Assuming the following class attributes and test case: 
```python
created_idents = {
***
### FunctionDef last_updated(self, model_cls)
**last_updated**: The function retrieves the set of objects that were last updated for a given model class. 

**parameters**: 
- self: The instance of the class. 
- model_cls: The model class for which the last updated objects are retrieved. 

**Code Description**: 
The 'last_updated' function is a method within the 'DBHistory' class. It utilizes the 'last' and '_idents_to_objects_set' functions to retrieve the set of objects that were last updated for the specified 'model_cls'. 

The 'last' function is called with 'model_cls' and the mode 'updated', which retrieves the set of identities of the 'model_cls' instances that were last updated. This set of identities is then passed to the '_idents_to_objects_set' function, along with 'model_cls', to fetch the corresponding objects from the database session. 

The '_idents_to_objects_set' function iterates over the provided identities and uses the 'get' method on the query object to retrieve each object. The result is returned as a set, ensuring uniqueness and eliminating duplicates. 

This function is used in the test cases 'test_models_history_updated' and 'test_models_history_created_with_scoped_session' to verify the expected behavior of the 'DBHistory' class when objects are updated. 

**Note**: 
- The 'last_updated' function relies on the dynamic attribute access and the assumption that the provided identifiers are valid and exist in the database. 
- The 'model_cls' parameter is essential to specify the model class for which the last updated objects are retrieved. 

**Output Example**: 
Assuming the following class attributes: 
```python
created_idents = {'ModelA': {1, 2, 3}, 'ModelB': {4, 5}}
updated_idents = {'ModelA': {2, 3}, 'ModelB': {5, 6}}
deleted_idents = {'ModelA': {1}, 'ModelB': {}}
```

And the following test case: 
```python
def test_models_history_updated(self):
    session = self.session
    user = User(name='test')
    session.add(user)
    session.commit()
    session.expire_all()
    with DBHistory(session) as history:
        user = session.query(User).get(user.id)
        user.name = 'test 1'
        session.commit()
        self.assertEqual(history.last_updated(User), set([user]))
```

The output of 'history.last_updated(User)' would be: 
```python
set([<User object at 0x...>]])
```

Where the 'User' object with the updated name 'test 1' is returned as the last updated instance of the 'User' model class.
***
### FunctionDef last_deleted(self, model_cls)
**last_deleted**: The function retrieves the identities of a given model class that were last deleted. 

**parameters**: 
- self: The instance of the class. 
- model_cls: The model class for which the last deleted identities are retrieved. 

**Code Description**: 
The 'last_deleted' function is a method within the 'DBHistory' class. It is used to access the identities of a specified model class that were last deleted. This function calls the 'last' method internally, passing 'deleted' as the mode, to retrieve the relevant identities. 

The function is utilized in the 'tests.py' module within the test cases 'test_models_history_init', 'test_models_history_created', 'test_models_history_created_with_scoped_session', 'test_models_history_updated', and 'test_models_history_deleted'. In these test cases, the function is used to assert the expected behavior of the 'DBHistory' class when tracking deleted identities. 

**Note**: 
- The 'last_deleted' function relies on the 'last' method to retrieve the identities, which in turn uses dynamic attribute access to access the appropriate set of identities based on the provided mode. 
- The 'model_cls' parameter is essential for specifying the model class of interest when retrieving the last deleted identities. 

**Output Example**: 
Assuming the following class attributes: 
```python
created_idents = {'ModelA': {1, 2, 3}, 'ModelB': {4, 5}}
updated_idents = {'ModelA': {2, 3}, 'ModelB': {5, 6}}
deleted_idents = {'ModelA': {1}, 'ModelB': {}}
```

Calling the 'last_deleted' function with a specific model class could yield the following result: 
```python
last_deleted(self, ModelA)  # Output: {1}
```
***
### FunctionDef assert_(self, model_cls, ident, mode)
**assert_****: The function performs assertions on the identities of a given model class based on the provided mode and optional identity.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- model_cls: The model class for which the assertions are performed.
- ident: Optional. The identity or identities to be asserted. If provided, it should be a single value or a tuple/list of values.
- mode: A string indicating the type of operation to assert; either 'created', 'updated', or 'deleted'.

**Code Description**:
The 'assert_' function is a method of the 'DBHistory' class and is used to perform assertions on the identities of the specified model class. It first calls the 'last' function with the provided 'model_cls' and 'mode' parameters to retrieve the set of identities that were last modified in the specified way. It then checks if any identities were returned and raises an assertion error with an informative message if none are found.

If an 'ident' is provided, the function further asserts that this identity or identities are present in the set of retrieved identities. It raises an assertion error with a detailed message if the 'ident' is not found.

This function is called by other methods within the same class: 'assert_created', 'assert_updated', and 'assert_deleted'. These methods use 'assert_' to perform the actual assertion based on the provided mode and then apply additional logic specific to each method.

**Note**:
- The 'assert_' function relies on the 'last' function to retrieve the set of identities based on the provided 'model_cls' and 'mode'.
- The 'ident' parameter allows for specific identity or identities to be asserted, providing more granular control over the assertion process.

**Output Example**:
Assuming the following class attributes:
```python
created_idents = {'ModelA': {1, 2, 3}, 'ModelB': {4, 5}}
updated_idents = {'ModelA': {2, 3}, 'ModelB': {5, 6}}
deleted_idents = {'ModelA': {1}, 'ModelB': {}}
```

Calling the 'assert_' function with different parameters could yield the following results:
```python
assert_(self, ModelA, 'created')  # Asserts that instances of ModelA were created
assert_(self, ModelB, 'updated', 5)  # Asserts that an instance of ModelB with identity 5 was updated
assert_(self, ModelA, 'deleted', (1, 2))  # Asserts that instances of ModelA with identities 1 and 2 were deleted
```
***
### FunctionDef assert_created(self, model_cls, ident)
**assert_created**: The function **assert_created** performs assertions to verify if instances of a given model class have been created.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- model_cls: The model class for which the assertions are performed.
- ident: Optional. The identity or identifier of the instance(s) to be asserted.

**Code Description**:
The 'assert_created' function is a method within the 'DBHistory' class. It is used to assert that instances of the specified model class have been created. The function first calls the '_idents_to_objects_set' function, which retrieves a set of objects corresponding to the provided identifiers for the given model class. This retrieval is facilitated by utilizing the database session's query function.

The '_idents_to_objects_set' function ensures that the returned objects are unique and eliminates duplicates. 'assert_created' then performs the actual assertion by checking if any objects were returned. If no objects are found, it raises an assertion error with an informative message.

This function is leveraged by other methods within the same class, such as 'assert_created_one', to perform specific assertions related to created instances.

**Note**:
- The 'assert_created' function relies on the '_idents_to_objects_set' function to retrieve the corresponding objects based on the provided identifiers and model class.
- It is important to ensure that the provided identifiers are valid and exist in the database, as the function does not handle missing or incorrect identifiers.

**Output Example**:
Assuming the following code snippet:
```python
with DBHistory(session) as history:
    user = User(name='test')
    session.add(user)
    session.commit()
    result = history.assert_created(User)
    result_with_ident = history.assert_created(User, user.id)
```

The output of 'result' would be a set containing the 'user' instance, indicating that an instance of the 'User' model class has been created. 'result_with_ident' would also return the same set, specifically asserting the creation of the 'user' instance with the provided identifier.
***
### FunctionDef assert_updated(self, model_cls, ident)
**assert_updated**: The function **assert_updated** performs assertions to verify if instances of a given model class have been updated. 

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- model_cls: The model class for which the assertions are performed to check for updated instances.
- ident: Optional. The identity or a collection of identities of the instances to be specifically asserted as updated.

**Code Description**:
The 'assert_updated' function is a part of the 'DBHistory' class and is used to assert the existence of updated instances for a specified model class. It utilizes the '_idents_to_objects_set' function to retrieve a set of objects corresponding to the provided 'model_cls' and 'ident' parameters. The '_idents_to_objects_set' function handles the retrieval of objects based on identifiers from the database session.

The 'assert_updated' function relies on the 'assert_' function, which performs assertions on the identities of the given model class. It checks if any instances of the model class have been updated and raises an assertion error if none are found. If an 'ident' is provided, the function further asserts that the specified identity or identities are among the updated instances.

This function is used by other methods within the same class, such as 'assert_updated_one', to perform specific assertions on updated instances.

**Note**:
- The 'assert_updated' function assumes that the provided identifiers are valid and exist in the database.
- This function is designed to work with the 'DBHistory' class and its specific methods, such as 'last_created', 'last_updated', and 'last_deleted'.

**Output Example**:
Assuming the following code snippet:
```python
with DBHistory(session) as history:
    user = User(name='test')
    session.add(user)
    session.commit()
    session.expire_all()
    user = session.query(User).get(user.id)
    user.name = 'test 1'
    session.commit()
    # Perform assertions
    history.assert_updated(User)
    history.assert_updated(User, user.id)
```

In the example above, 'assert_updated' is called with the 'User' model class to assert that instances of 'User' have been updated. It is also called with an additional 'ident' parameter to specifically assert that the instance with the corresponding 'user.id' has been updated.
***
### FunctionDef assert_deleted(self, model_cls, ident)
**assert_deleted**: The function performs assertions to verify if instances of a given model class have been deleted.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- model_cls: The model class for which the deletion assertions are performed.
- ident: Optional. The identity or identities of the instances that are expected to be deleted. If provided, it should be a single value or a tuple/list of values.

**Code Description**:
The 'assert_deleted' function is a part of the 'DBHistory' class and is used to verify if instances of a specified model class have been deleted. It is a wrapper function that calls the 'assert_' function with the 'mode' parameter set to 'deleted'. This means it checks if there are any identities of the given model class that were deleted and, optionally, if specific identities provided in the 'ident' parameter were deleted.

The function first calls the 'last' function (indirectly through 'assert_') with the provided 'model_cls' and 'mode' set to 'deleted' to retrieve the set of identities that were last deleted. It then checks if any identities were returned and raises an assertion error if none are found, indicating that no instances of the model class were deleted.

If an 'ident' is provided, the function further asserts that this specific identity or identities are present in the set of retrieved deleted identities. If the 'ident' is not found, an assertion error is raised with a detailed message.

This function is used in the 'test_models_history_deleted' test case to verify that instances of the 'User' model class have been deleted. It is also called by the 'assert_deleted_one' function, which further specializes the assertion to check for the deletion of a single instance.

**Note**:
- The 'assert_deleted' function relies on the 'last' and 'assert_' functions to retrieve and perform assertions on the set of deleted identities.
- The 'ident' parameter allows for specific identity or identities to be checked for deletion, providing more granular control over the assertion process.

**Output Example**:
Assuming the following class attributes:
```python
deleted_idents = {'ModelA': {1, 2}, 'ModelB': {}}
```

Calling the 'assert_deleted' function with different parameters could yield the following results:
```python
assert_deleted(self, ModelA)  # Asserts that instances of ModelA were deleted
assert_deleted(self, ModelB, 1)  # Asserts that an instance of ModelB with identity 1 was deleted
```
***
### FunctionDef assert_one(self, dataset, model_cls, mode)
**assert_one**: The function **assert_one** checks if a dataset contains only one instance of a specific model class in a particular mode and returns that instance. 

**parameters**:
- dataset: The collection of instances to be checked and from which the single instance will be returned.
- model_cls: The specific model class that the function is checking for.
- mode: The mode or state indicating the condition of the instance, e.g., 'created', 'deleted', or 'updated'.

**Code Description**: This function first checks the length of the dataset. If it does not contain exactly one instance (i.e., its length is not equal to 1), an AssertionError is raised, indicating that there should be only one instance of the specified model class in the given mode. The error message includes the actual number of instances found, the model class name, and the mode. If the dataset length is correct, the function returns the single instance from the dataset by using the pop() method, which removes and returns the last item from the collection.

This function is used by other methods in the DBHistory class, such as assert_created_one, assert_deleted_one, and assert_updated_one, to ensure that only one instance of the specified model class has been created, deleted, or updated, respectively. These methods call assert_one with the appropriate arguments to verify the presence of a single instance in the dataset and then return that instance for further processing or assertion.

**Note**: This function specifically checks for one instance in the dataset. If multiple instances are expected or allowed, other assertion methods should be used instead.

**Output Example**:
```python
instance = assert_one(dataset, MyModelClass, 'created')
print(instance)
# Output: <__main__.MyModelClass object at 0x7f1234567890>
```

In this example, assert_one is used to retrieve and return the single instance of MyModelClass from the dataset, assuming it has been created recently ('created' mode). The returned instance can then be used for further assertions or testing.
***
### FunctionDef assert_created_one(self, model_cls)
**assert_created_one**: The function **assert_created_one** verifies if only one instance of a given model class has been created and returns that instance. 

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- model_cls: The model class for which the assertion is performed.

**Code Description**: This function first calls the 'assert_created' method to verify if instances of the specified model class have been created. It then utilizes the 'assert_one' method to check if the dataset contains exactly one instance of the given model class in the 'created' mode. If the assertion is successful, the single instance of the model class is returned. If the dataset does not contain exactly one instance, an AssertionError is raised, indicating that only one instance should exist in the created state. 

This function is used in the 'test_models_history_created' and 'test_models_history_created_with_scoped_session' test methods to ensure that only one instance of a specific model class has been created. It combines the functionality of 'assert_created' and 'assert_one' to provide a concise way to assert and retrieve the single created instance of a model class. 

**Note**: This function specifically checks for one instance in the 'created' mode. If multiple instances are expected or the model class is in a different mode, other assertion methods or approaches should be utilized. 

**Output Example**:
Assuming the following code snippet:
```python
with DBHistory(session) as history:
    user = User(name='test')
    session.add(user)
    session.commit()
    created_user = history.assert_created_one(User)
```

The output of 'created_user' would be the single instance of the 'User' model class that was created, allowing for further assertions or testing on that specific instance.
***
### FunctionDef assert_deleted_one(self, model_cls)
**assert_deleted_one**: The function **assert_deleted_one** verifies if a single instance of a given model class has been deleted and returns the deleted instance's identity. 

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- model_cls: The model class for which the deletion assertion is performed.

**Code Description**: This function is a specialized version of the 'assert_deleted' function, which checks for the deletion of a single instance. It first calls 'assert_deleted' to retrieve the set of identities that were last deleted for the provided 'model_cls'. Then, it utilizes the 'assert_one' function to ensure that only one instance has been deleted. If more or no instances are found, an AssertionError is raised with a detailed message. The 'assert_one' function also returns the single instance's identity, which is then returned by 'assert_deleted_one'.

This function is used in the 'test_models_history_deleted' test case to verify that a single instance of the 'User' model class has been deleted. It provides a convenient way to assert and retrieve the identity of the deleted instance in a single step.

**Note**: The 'assert_deleted_one' function relies on the 'assert_deleted' and 'assert_one' functions for its functionality. It is specifically designed to handle the deletion of a single instance, and if multiple deletions are expected, other assertion methods should be utilized.

**Output Example**:
Assuming the following class attributes:
```python
deleted_idents = {'User': {(1,)} }
```

Calling the 'assert_deleted_one' function with the 'User' model class could yield the following result:
```python
assert_deleted_one(self, User)  # Returns (1,) indicating the identity of the deleted 'User' instance
```
***
### FunctionDef assert_updated_one(self, model_cls)
**assert_updated_one**: The function **assert_updated_one** checks if there is exactly one instance of a specific model class that has been updated and returns that instance. 

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- model_cls: The model class for which the assertion is performed to check for a single updated instance.

**Code Description**: This function combines the functionality of **assert_updated** and **assert_one**. It first calls **assert_updated** to verify if any instances of the given model class have been updated. Then, it utilizes **assert_one** to ensure that only one instance is found in the 'updated' mode and returns that instance. 

The purpose of **assert_updated_one** is to provide a convenient way to assert and retrieve the single updated instance of a model class. It is particularly useful when you want to perform further assertions or testing on that specific instance. 

**Note**: This function specifically checks for one updated instance. If multiple updates are expected or allowed, consider using other assertion methods provided by the DBHistory class.

**Output Example**:
Assuming the following code snippet:
```python
with DBHistory(session) as history:
    user = User(name='test')
    session.add(user)
    session.commit()
    session.expire_all()
    user = session.query(User).get(user.id)
    user.name = 'test 1'
    session.commit()
    # Perform assertions
    updated_user = history.assert_updated_one(User)
    print(updated_user)
```

In the example above, 'assert_updated_one' is called with the 'User' model class to assert and retrieve the single updated instance of 'User'. The returned 'updated_user' instance can then be used for further processing or testing.
***
### FunctionDef assert_nothing_happened(self)
**assert_nothing_happened**: The function **assert_nothing_happened** is used to verify that no database operations, including creation, update, or deletion of records, have taken place within a specific context. 

**parameters**: 
- self: The instance of the DBHistory class, allowing access to the internal state and methods of the object. 

**Code Description**: This function is designed to be used as an assertion, ensuring that no database changes have occurred during a particular test or code block. It checks three specific conditions: 
1. **Creation Check**: It asserts that no new records have been created, verified by checking the `created_idents` attribute of the `DBHistory` instance. If any identifiers are present, indicating newly created records, an `AssertionError` is raised with the message 'Something is created'. 
2. **Update Check**: Similarly, it checks the `updated_idents` attribute to ensure that no existing records have been updated. If updates are detected, an `AssertionError` is raised with the message 'Something is updated'. 
3. **Deletion Check**: The function also examines the `deleted_idents` attribute to confirm that no records have been deleted. If deletions are found, an `AssertionError` is triggered with the message 'Something is deleted'. 

This function is particularly useful in testing scenarios, as evidenced by its usage in the `tests.py` module. It helps validate the expected behavior of database operations, ensuring that changes have occurred when intended and that no unintended side effects have taken place. 

For example, in `test_nothing_happened_does_not_throw_when_nothing_happened`, the function is used to confirm that simply querying records (without any modifications) does not trigger the assertions. Conversely, in `test_nothing_happened_throws_on_creating`, `test_nothing_happened_throws_on_update`, and `test_nothing_happened_throws_on_delete`, the function is expected to raise an `AssertionError` when database operations (creation, update, or deletion) are performed, demonstrating that the assertions correctly catch these changes. 

**Note**: This function assumes that the `created_idents`, `updated_idents`, and `deleted_idents` attributes are properly populated by the `DBHistory` class, tracking the respective database operations. Ensure that the `DBHistory` context is correctly managed to capture the desired scope of operations for accurate assertion results.
***
### FunctionDef clear(self)
**clear**: The function **clear** resets the internal state of the DBHistory object by clearing the sets that track created, updated, and deleted identifiers, and then calling the internal method **clear_cache** to reset the cache.

**parameters**: This function takes no parameters.

**Code Description**: The **clear** function is used to reset the internal state of the DBHistory object, ensuring that any identifiers previously tracked as created, updated, or deleted are cleared. This is achieved by initializing the **created_idents**, **updated_idents**, and **deleted_idents** dictionaries to empty dictionaries. Following this, the function calls **clear_cache**, an internal method that resets the cache by initializing the sets tracking created, updated, and deleted items to empty sets. This two-step process ensures that both the identifiers and the cache are cleared, providing a fresh starting point for tracking changes.

The **clear** function is an important tool for managing the state of the DBHistory object. It is typically called at specific points in the code to ensure that the object's internal state is reset as needed. For example, this function might be invoked when entering or exiting a context, after a commit or rollback, or when explicitly clearing the history. By clearing the identifiers and cache, the **clear** function helps maintain the accuracy and consistency of the DBHistory object's internal state.

**Note**: The **clear** function is an internal method of the DBHistory class and is not intended to be called directly by users. It is an essential part of the class's functionality, providing a mechanism to reset the object's state and cache at specific points in the code. This function should be used with care, as it will remove all previously tracked identifiers and cache data, potentially impacting the ability to track historical changes if invoked at an inappropriate time.
***
### FunctionDef clear_cache(self)
**clear_cache**: The function **clear_cache** resets the internal cache of the DBHistory object by clearing the sets that track created, updated, and deleted items.

**parameters**: This function takes no parameters.

**Code Description**: The **clear_cache** function is used to reset the internal cache of the DBHistory object. It does this by initializing the **_created**, **_updated**, and **_deleted** sets to empty sets. This function is called by various methods within the DBHistory class to ensure that the cache is cleared at specific points, such as when entering or exiting a context, after a commit or rollback, or when explicitly clearing the history.

**Note**: The **clear_cache** function is an internal method used by DBHistory to manage its cache. It is not intended to be called directly by users but is an important part of the DBHistory class's functionality, ensuring that the cache is maintained correctly.
***
### FunctionDef __enter__(self)
**__enter__**: The function **__enter__** sets up event listeners for specific database events and manages the internal cache of the DBHistory object.

**parameters**:
· self: The instance of the DBHistory class.

**Code Description**: The **__enter__** function is called when entering a context, typically using a 'with' statement. It sets up event listeners for the 'after_flush', 'after_commit', and 'after_soft_rollback' events by utilizing the event.listen method. These event listeners are essential for tracking changes in the database and managing the internal state of the DBHistory object.

Inside the function, event listeners are registered for the following functions:
- _after_flush: This function is triggered after a flush event in the database and is responsible for updating the _created, _updated, and _deleted attributes of the DBHistory object.
- _after_commit: This function is called after a successful database transaction and updates the identity information of the objects involved.
- _after_soft_rollback: Triggered after a soft rollback event, this function clears the internal cache of the DBHistory object.

Additionally, the **__enter__** function calls the clear_cache method to reset the internal cache. This ensures that any existing cache is cleared before entering the context, providing a clean starting point for tracking database changes.

**Note**: The **__enter__** function is an internal method used by the DBHistory class to set up the necessary event listeners and manage its internal cache. It is not intended to be called directly by users but plays a crucial role in the proper functioning of the DBHistory context.

**Output Example**: When using the DBHistory object in a 'with' statement, the **__enter__** function is called implicitly. Here's an example of how it could be used:

```python
with DBHistory() as history:
    # Work with the database
    # history._after_flush, history._after_commit, and history._after_rollback
    # will be triggered automatically based on database events
    pass
# The __exit__ method will be called implicitly after exiting the 'with' block
```

In this example, the **__enter__** function is invoked when entering the 'with' block, setting up the event listeners and managing the cache. The database operations are then performed within the block, and the appropriate event listeners are triggered automatically based on the database events. Finally, when exiting the 'with' block, the **__exit__** method is called implicitly to perform any necessary cleanup, such as removing the event listeners.

### FunctionDef __exit__(self, type, value, traceback)
**__exit__**: The function **__exit__** is responsible for performing cleanup operations when exiting a context related to the DBHistory class.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the DBHistory class.
- type: The type of the exception that occurred, or None if the context is exited normally.
- value: The exception instance that occurred, or None if no exception was raised.
- traceback: The traceback object that provides information about the exception's execution context, or None if no exception was raised.

**Code Description**: The **__exit__** function is an essential component of the DBHistory class, ensuring proper cleanup when exiting a context. It is one of the methods that define a context manager for the class. Within this function, several important operations are performed:
1. **Event Listener Removal**: The function removes event listeners that were previously set up in the **__enter__** method. Specifically, it removes the event listeners for 'after_flush', 'after_commit', and 'after_soft_rollback' events. This is important to ensure that the associated event handlers are not triggered unexpectedly outside of the context.
2. **Cache Clearing**: The **__exit__** function calls the **clear_cache** method, which resets the internal cache of the DBHistory object. By clearing the sets that track created, updated, and deleted items, the cache is left in a clean state, ready for subsequent operations or a new context.

The **__exit__** method is typically called automatically when using the DBHistory class as a context manager, ensuring that the necessary cleanup takes place regardless of whether the context is exited normally or due to an exception.

**Note**: The **__exit__** function plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the DBHistory class's internal state. It ensures that any event listeners are properly removed and that the cache is cleared, providing a clean slate for future operations or contexts. This function is not intended to be called directly by users but is an integral part of the class's context management functionality.

### FunctionDef _populate_idents_dict(self, idents, objects)
**_populate_idents_dict**: The function **_populate_idents_dict** is responsible for populating the identity dictionary with object identifiers.

**parameters**: 
- idents: The identity dictionary to be populated. It is expected to be a dictionary where the keys are the primary identifiers of the objects, and the values are sets containing the secondary identifiers.
- objects: A list of objects for which the identifiers will be extracted and populated into the idents dictionary.

**Code Description**: This function iterates over the list of objects and, for each object, it uses the util.identity_key function to extract the primary and secondary identifiers. The primary identifier is used as the key in the idents dictionary, and the secondary identifier is added to the set corresponding to the primary key. If the set for a particular primary key does not exist yet, it is created using the setdefault method.

This function is called by the _after_commit method of the DBHistory class. It is used to populate the created_idents, updated_idents, and deleted_idents dictionaries with the respective object identifiers after a database transaction. The _after_commit method is triggered when a transaction is committed, and it ensures that the identity information of the objects is up-to-date in the idents dictionaries.

**Note**: The _populate_idents_dict function relies on the util.identity_key function to extract the object identifiers. It is important to ensure that this function is properly implemented and returns the correct identifier values.

### FunctionDef _after_flush(self, db, flush_context, instances)
**_after_flush**: The function **_after_flush** is responsible for updating the **_created**, **_updated**, and **_deleted** attributes of the DBHistory class. It is triggered after a flush event occurs in the database.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the DBHistory class.
- db: The database object.
- flush_context: The context of the flush event.
- instances (optional): Specific instances to be considered.

**Code Description**:
This function is an essential component of the DBHistory class, which appears to be designed to track changes in the database. When a flush event occurs, indicating that changes have been made to the database, **_after_flush** is called to update the appropriate attributes.

The function utilizes the provided db object to access three special sets: db.new, db.dirty, and db.deleted. These sets likely represent newly created, modified, and deleted instances, respectively. By using the identityset_to_set helper function, it converts these sets into a standard format, ensuring consistency.

The function then performs a union operation between the current values of **_created**, **_updated**, and **_deleted** attributes and the corresponding sets from the db object. This effectively adds any new, modified, or deleted instances to the respective tracking lists maintained by the DBHistory class.

**Note**:
The **_after_flush** function is registered as an event listener in the __enter__ method of the DBHistory class, ensuring its execution after a flush event. It is also removed as a listener in the __exit__ method, providing proper cleanup.

**Output Example**:
Assuming some database changes have occurred, the output of **_after_flush** could be:
```python
self._created = {<newly_created_instance1>, <newly_created_instance2>, ...}
self._updated = {<modified_instance1>, <modified_instance2>, ...}
self._deleted = {<deleted_instance1>, <deleted_instance2>, ...}
```

In this example, the _created, _updated, and _deleted attributes now contain sets of instances that were created, modified, or deleted during the database flush.
#### FunctionDef identityset_to_set(obj)
**identityset_to_set**: The function transforms the internal _members attribute of an object into a standard set.

**parameters**: 
- obj: The only parameter required by the function is the object for which you want to perform the transformation.

**Code Description**: This function, identityset_to_set, is designed to convert the _members attribute of an object into a standard set data structure. The _members attribute is typically a dictionary-like object that maintains the items associated with the object. By applying this function, the attribute is transformed into a set, providing an efficient way to store and manipulate unique values associated with the object. This transformation can be particularly useful when you need to perform set-like operations on the members, such as unions, intersections, or difference calculations.

**Note**: This function specifically targets the _members attribute, assuming it follows a dictionary-like structure with key-value pairs. The function extracts the values from this attribute to create a set. Ensure that the provided object has this attribute with the expected structure for the function to work correctly.

**Output Example**: 
Assuming the obj parameter is an instance of a class with an _members attribute, such as _members = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}, the function would return: {1, 2, 3}

### FunctionDef _after_commit(self, db)
**_after_commit**: The function **_after_commit** is triggered after a database transaction is committed and is responsible for updating the identity information of the objects involved in the transaction. 

**parameters**: 
· db: The database connection or transaction object. 

**Code Description**: The **_after_commit** function is called by the DBHistory class to ensure that the identity dictionaries (created_idents, updated_idents, and deleted_idents) are populated with the respective object identifiers after a successful database transaction. It first checks if the transaction is nested and, if so, returns without performing any further actions. This is because, for nested transactions, the _after_commit event is triggered within the _flush method, which is unexpected behavior. 

Then, the function proceeds to populate the identity dictionaries by calling the _populate_idents_dict method for each of the created, updated, and deleted object sets (self._created, self._updated, and self._deleted, respectively). The _populate_idents_dict method extracts the primary and secondary identifiers of the objects and populates the corresponding identity dictionary. 

Finally, the _after_commit function calls the clear_cache method to reset the internal cache of the DBHistory object. This ensures that the sets tracking created, updated, and deleted items are cleared, providing a clean slate for the next set of operations. 

**Note**: The _after_commit function is an internal method of the DBHistory class and is not intended to be called directly by users. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the object identity information within the DBHistory context. 

**Output Example**: None. This function does not return any value. It is responsible for updating internal state and triggering subsequent actions, such as clearing the cache.
***
### FunctionDef _after_rollback(self, db, prev_tx)
**_after_rollback**: The function **_after_rollback** is called after a soft rollback event and is responsible for clearing the internal cache of the DBHistory object.

**parameters**:
· self: A reference to the instance of the DBHistory class.
· db: The database connection or transaction.
· prev_tx: The previous transaction.

**Code Description**: The **_after_rollback** function is an internal method used by the DBHistory class to manage its cache. It is triggered by the 'after_soft_rollback' event and ensures that the cache is cleared after a rollback operation. This function calls the **clear_cache** method, which resets the internal cache by initializing the sets that track created, updated, and deleted items to empty sets. This step ensures that the cache is maintained correctly and is ready for subsequent operations.

The **_after_rollback** function is called by the **__enter__** and **__exit__** methods of the DBHistory class. When entering a context, the **__enter__** method sets up event listeners, including one for the 'after_soft_rollback' event, and then calls **_after_rollback** to ensure the cache is cleared at the start. Similarly, when exiting a context, the **__exit__** method removes the event listeners and again calls **_after_rollback** to clear the cache, ensuring that any changes made within the context are not persisted.

**Note**: The **_after_rollback** function is an internal method and is not intended to be called directly by users. It is an important part of the DBHistory class's functionality, ensuring proper cache management during rollback events.
